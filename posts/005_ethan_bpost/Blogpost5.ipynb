    "In the first 50 days of President Donald Trump's second term, his administration enacted a series of policy changes and executive orders with significant socio-economic implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Changes and Executive Orders**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immigration**: On his first day, President Trump declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, reinstated the \"remain in Mexico\" policy, and designated Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations. He also signed an order to end birthright citizenship for descendants of illegal immigrants. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trade and Tariffs**: The administration imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and a 10% tariff on imports from China, aiming to reduce the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. Additionally, plans for reciprocal tariffs on foreign nations were announced, set to take effect in April. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Programs**: An executive order was issued to dismantle DEI initiatives within the federal government, affecting workplace inclusivity efforts. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Energy and Environmental Policies**: The administration declared a national energy emergency favoring fossil fuel production, rolled back electric vehicle targets, and halted wind energy projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Socio-Economic Impact**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Economic Uncertainty**: The new tariffs and strained international relations have contributed to economic uncertainty. Business and consumer sentiment have declined, manufacturing has weakened, and stock prices have dropped, potentially slowing consumer spending. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stock Market Performance**: The stock market experienced its worst start since 2009, with the S&P 500 index falling by 6.4%, the Nasdaq Composite dropping by 11%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreasing by 3.6%. This decline reflects investor concerns over potential economic downturns and policy ambiguities. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consumer Prices and Inflation**: The tariffs are expected to raise prices on various goods, fueling inflation and economic instability. Companies may pass on increased costs to consumers, leading to reduced consumer spending and confidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Employment**: While employment growth persists, new tariffs and retaliatory actions may reverse this trend. The Federal Reserve faces challenges in navigating these uncertainties, with increased near-term recession risks. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **International Relations**: The administration's policies have strained relations with key trading partners, leading to retaliatory measures. For example, Canadian travel to the U.S. has significantly declined following tariff tensions, potentially resulting in economic losses for the U.S. tourism industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, President Trump's initial 50 days have been marked by assertive policy shifts and executive actions, leading to notable socio-economic consequences. The long-term effects of these policies remain to be seen as the administration continues to navigate complex domestic and international challenges."

    "# First 50 Days of Trump’s 2025 Presidency: Policy Shifts, Executive Orders, and Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "In his first 50 days back in office (January 20 – March 10, 2025), President Donald Trump pursued a whirlwind of policy changes and executive actions. These moves spanned domestic and foreign affairs and were accompanied by immediate economic and social reactions. Below is an in-depth analysis of this period, organized into policy changes, key executive orders, and socio-economic impacts.\n",

    "## Policy Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domestic Policy Shifts  \n",
    "Trump rapidly reversed many of his predecessor’s domestic policies and introduced new initiatives reflecting his 2016–2020 agenda. **Immigration enforcement tightened significantly.** On Day 1, Trump signed orders to **“Secure Our Borders”** and **“Protect the American People Against Invasion,”** reinstating strict border controls and nullifying several of President Biden’s 2021 immigration directives ([\n",

These actions restarted border wall construction and imposed tougher asylum and deportation rules, prompting legal challenges by immigrant advocacy groups. Trump also moved to **realign the U.S. refugee program**, slashing refugee admissions and revoking Biden’s earlier refugee order ([\n",

    "**Economic and regulatory policy** took a sharp turn. The administration imposed a regulatory freeze and launched a “Department of Government Efficiency” initiative to shrink the federal bureaucracy ([Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press](https://capitalpress.com/2025/03/13/trump-sets-torrid-pace-in-first-50-days-in-office/#:~:text=Trump%20has%20heralded%20the%20end,for%20such%20affection%20that%20evening)). A hiring near-freeze was implemented alongside plans to cut tens of thousands of federal jobs (e.g. a leaked memo outlined **80,000 layoffs at the VA** alone) ([Today's AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO](https://ky.aflcio.org/news/todays-afl-cio-press-clips-855#:~:text=The%20Department%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs,Wednesday%20by%20The%20Associated%20Press)). High-profile business advisor Elon Musk was tasked to lead the efficiency drive, even appearing with Trump in Congress as head of the new initiative ([Today's AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO](https://ky.aflcio.org/news/todays-afl-cio-press-clips-855#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20shoutout%20to,gave%20him%20a%20standing%20ovation)). Trump’s team also signaled intent to **abolish the Department of Education**, with a draft executive order directing the Education Secretary to plan the department’s closure ([Today's AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO](https://ky.aflcio.org/news/todays-afl-cio-press-clips-855#:~:text=March%205%2C%202025)).

    "\n",
    "The administration swiftly **dismantled diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs** across the government. One early order **revoked dozens of prior executive orders** dating back to the 1960s that had mandated affirmative action and diversity initiatives ([\n",

Each of these actions was met with praise from social conservatives and protests from LGBTQ and women’s rights advocates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump’s **energy and environmental policy** reversed course from the prior administration. He declared a **“National Energy Emergency”** on Day 1 to boost fossil fuel production ([\n",

    "      Executive Orders\n",

    "      Executive Orders\n",
    "    ](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025#:~:text=Permalink)).

    "      Executive Orders\n",
    "    ](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025#:~:text=Permalink)). The administration also greenlit projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and Arctic oil development (“Unleashing Alaska’s Resource Potential”) ([\n",

Fossil fuel industries and allied lawmakers applauded these steps, while environmental groups decried the U.S. exit from international climate efforts (the Day 1 order **“Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements”** signaled withdrawal from the Paris Accord commitments) ([\n",

    "### Foreign Policy Shifts  \n",
    "Trump’s early foreign policy moves reflected an “America First” approach marked by retrenchment from global institutions and confrontational trade measures. Immediately upon taking office, he **withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO)** ([\n",

Allies and international observers expressed concern at these steps, warning of diminished U.S. influence in global health and democracy promotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump quickly **upended U.S. trade policy**.

These orders targeted a wide range of policies. Below are some of the most significant EOs from this period, along with their intent and immediate effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“Initial Rescissions of Harmful EOs and Actions” (EO 14148, Jan 20, 2025):** This sweeping Day 1 order **nullified many of President Biden’s executive orders** on climate, equity, immigration, and more ([\n",

It revoked at least 17 orders signed in 2021 (including orders on racial equity, climate regulations, and immigration) ([\n",

    "\n",
    "- **“Securing Our Borders” (EO 14165, Jan 20, 2025):** One of several immigration orders signed immediately, it directed the **construction of new border barriers** and deployment of resources to the southern border ([\n",

    "      Executive Orders\n",
    "    ](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025#:~:text=)). It also ended the practice of catch-and-release and reinstated Trump-era asylum restrictions that Biden had rolled back. *Intent:* Fulfill campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration and “finish the wall.” *Consequences:* Within days, contractors were notified to resume border wall projects, and border patrol began operating under tougher rules. Immigration advocacy groups filed lawsuits, and by mid-February, federal courts were reviewing challenges to these policies on humanitarian and legal grounds (e.g., questioning the reinstated asylum limits).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists” (EO 14161, Jan 20, 2025):** This order effectively **reimposed a travel ban** by suspending entry of individuals from several countries deemed high-risk for terrorism ([\n",
    "      Federal Register\n",

    "      Executive Orders\n",
    "    ](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025#:~:text=)). It expanded on Trump’s 2017 travel ban, adding new vetting measures. *Intent:* Prevent terrorist infiltration by tightening visa issuance and entry from certain Middle Eastern and African nations. *Immediate consequence:* Travel from the affected countries was abruptly halted, stranding some travelers and drawing protest from civil liberties groups. The order faced immediate court challenges, recalling the legal battles from 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“Unleashing American Energy” (EO 14154, Jan 20, 2025):** A comprehensive energy order that **rolled back environmental regulations** and prioritized fossil fuel development ([\n",

    "      Executive Orders\n",
    "    ](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025#:~:text=Permalink)) and instructed agencies to expedite permits for oil, gas, and coal projects. *Intent:* Promote energy independence and economic growth by removing “burdensome” green regulations. *Consequences:* The Department of Interior promptly restarted oil lease sales on federal land, and the EPA moved to loosen emissions standards. Oil and gas companies’ stock prices rose on anticipation of friendlier policy, while environmental organizations mobilized opposition, with some states preparing lawsuits citing environmental harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“Department of Government Efficiency” Initiative (EO 14158, Jan 20, 2025):** This order created a new cross-agency task force (dubbed the **Department of Government Efficiency, or “DOGE”**) to **cut federal jobs, slash regulations, and reorganize agencies** ([\n",

Federal employee unions reacted with outrage – by early March, union-led protests at state capitols and in D.C. drew thousands, decrying “illegal mass firings” and the influence of Musk in government ([Today's AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO](https://ky.aflcio.org/news/todays-afl-cio-press-clips-855#:~:text=The%20protest%20was%20organized%20by,the%20workforce%20being%20let%20go)) ([Today's AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO](https://ky.aflcio.org/news/todays-afl-cio-press-clips-855#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20shoutout%20to,gave%20him%20a%20standing%20ovation)). Multiple lawsuits were filed claiming that summary dismissals of civil servants violated federal law, and some judges issued initial injunctions to temporarily halt certain layoffs ([Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press](https://capitalpress.com/2025/03/13/trump-sets-torrid-pace-in-first-50-days-in-office/#:~:text=Judges%20have%20slowed%20down%20Trump,pulled%20back%2C%20particularly%20on%20tariffs)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs” (EO 14151, Jan 20, 2025):** This order abolished **diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in federal agencies**, labeling them as ideological indoctrination ([\n",

    "    ](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025#:~:text=FR%20Doc.%20Number%3A%202025)). It rescinded mandates that agencies consider diversity in hiring and contracting. *Intent:* Remove what Trump viewed as politicized “woke” programs from government. *Consequences:* Agencies like the State Department and Pentagon immediately canceled unconscious bias trainings and disbanded DEI councils. Supporters argued this restored focus on merit, but critics within and outside government warned it would foster discrimination. The abrupt cancellation of longstanding programs also led to uncertainty in compliance for federal contractors until guidance was clarified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“Withdrawing the U.S. from the WHO” (EO 14155, Jan 20, 2025):** As part of Trump’s foreign policy shift, this order **formally initiated U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization** and redirected global health funds elsewhere ([\n",
    "      Federal Register\n",
    "       :: \n",

    "    ](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025#:~:text=,From%20the%20World%20Health%20Organization)). *Intent:* Protest and cut ties with an international body Trump accused of mismanagement (echoing his 2020 stance during COVID-19). *Immediate consequence:* The State Department halted the disbursement of U.S. dues to WHO. Health experts warned that American absence could weaken global pandemic preparedness. By late February, Congress was debating measures to possibly override this decision, and some bipartisan concern emerged about losing influence to China in the WHO.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tariff Orders (“Imposing Duties” series, Feb 1–Feb 6, 2025):** Trump issued multiple executive orders to **levy tariffs on imports** from China, Mexico, and Canada under various justifications ([\n",

    "      Executive Orders\n",

    "      Executive Orders\n",
    "    ](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025#:~:text=)). *Intent:* Use executive authority to reshape trade terms and compel foreign cooperation on U.S. priorities. *Consequences:* These unilateral tariffs roiled markets and foreign relations. China and Mexico threatened retaliation, and Canada prepared WTO complaints. U.S. companies depending on imported inputs faced higher costs, and trade associations warned of supply chain disruptions. Within a month, Trump temporarily eased some tariffs amid legal scrutiny and negotiations (illustrating the on-and-off “whiplash” nature of his trade actions ([US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-job-openings-increase-january-layoffs-decline-2025-03-11/#:~:text=There%20were%201,shaken%20business%20and%20consumer%20confidence))).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these executive orders had immediate ripple effects. Supporters of Trump’s actions praised the decisive implementation of campaign promises. Opponents, however, turned to the courts: in fact, **113 lawsuits were filed in the first 50 days** against various Trump policies ([Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press](https://capitalpress.com/2025/03/13/trump-sets-torrid-pace-in-first-50-days-in-office/#:~:text=number%20of%20executive%20orders%20he,year%20term)). Judges issued early injunctions on some orders (e.g. blocking the freeze of certain congressionally approved funds and the firing of independent officials) ([Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press](https://capitalpress.com/2025/03/13/trump-sets-torrid-pace-in-first-50-days-in-office/#:~:text=Judges%20have%20slowed%20down%20Trump,pulled%20back%2C%20particularly%20on%20tariffs)).

According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups, companies were concerned about the uncertainty of Trump’s policies – especially trade policy “whiplash” and the aggressive regulatory swings.

Sectors like agriculture and manufacturing, which are sensitive to trade, grew worried about export markets. At the same time, industries favored by Trump’s agenda experienced optimism: oil and gas executives, for example, voiced confidence that deregulation would boost production and profits, and defense contractors anticipated higher military spending given Trump’s promises to “restore America’s fighting force” (per his executive orders) ([\n",

    " ([‘Not My President’s Day’: Thousands Gather in Protest Against Trump](https://www.rsn.org/001/not-my-presidents-day-thousands-gather-in-protest-against-trump.html?print=1)) *Protesters rally near the U.S. Capitol on Presidents’ Day 2025 against President Trump’s early agenda. An upside-down American flag (a sign of distress) is flown as demonstrators oppose what they call “antidemocratic” actions by the administration ([‘Not My President’s Day’: Thousands Gather in Protest Against Trump - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2025/02/thousands-gather-protest-against-trump-musk/681721/#:~:text=Protesters%20rallied%20in%20cities%20across,California%20to%20Massachusetts%20and%20Florida)).*\n",

    "Legal challenges also surged as part of the social response. As noted, over 100 lawsuits were filed in the first several weeks, coming from states, NGOs, and affected individuals ([Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press](https://capitalpress.com/2025/03/13/trump-sets-torrid-pace-in-first-50-days-in-office/#:~:text=number%20of%20executive%20orders%20he,year%20term)). Courts began to act as a check: for example, a federal judge blocked the administration from firing a member of the NLRB without cause, questioning Trump’s broad claim of removal power ([Today's AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO](https://ky.aflcio.org/news/todays-afl-cio-press-clips-855#:~:text=By%20Daniel%20Wiessner)). Another court ordered the temporary unfreezing of certain congressionally appropriated funds that the administration had tried to halt ([Today's AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO](https://ky.aflcio.org/news/todays-afl-cio-press-clips-855#:~:text=March%206%2C%202025)) (such as a case where the National Endowment for Democracy sued over $239 million in withheld grants). These early legal interventions slowed some of Trump’s initiatives, though many cases remained to be decided.\n",

    "On the whole, the **socio-economic landscape in early 2025 was one of heightened turbulence.** Economic indicators showed a recovery that was still intact but facing new headwinds from protectionist policies. Financial markets and business leaders signaled concern over policy instability, even as Trump touted the stock market when it rose and downplayed downturns as “adjustments.” Socially, the country experienced deepening polarization: Trump’s base remained energized by his rapid actions, while opponents mounted a “resistance” that included nationwide protests, legal battles, and public campaigns to defend vulnerable communities (immigrants, LGBTQ individuals, etc.) affected by the new policies.\n",

    "Objectively, by the 50th day of Trump’s term, **significant change was underway**. The administration claimed “swift and unrelenting” progress on its agenda ([Today's AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO](https://ky.aflcio.org/news/todays-afl-cio-press-clips-855#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20touted%20the,to%20distance%20himself%20from%20it)), pointing to dozens of fulfilled promises such as tax cut proposals (unveiled in outline to Congress) and the rollback of liberal policies. Economic data showed some positive signs like lower inflation, but also flashing warnings in sentiment and markets. The country’s political discourse had shifted to debates over executive power, with Trump asserting expansive authority to reshape government and critics arguing he was overstepping constitutional bounds. In just 50 days, Trump “accomplished more…than most administrations accomplish in four or eight years,” he boasted to Congress ([Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press](https://capitalpress.com/2025/03/13/trump-sets-torrid-pace-in-first-50-days-in-office/#:~:text=On%20March%204%2C%20a%20week,just%20getting%20started%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). Whether one views that as a list of achievements or alarms, there is no doubt that the first 50 days of 2025 set a decisive and contentious tone – one that would define the trajectory of the Trump administration and its impact on the United States.\n",
