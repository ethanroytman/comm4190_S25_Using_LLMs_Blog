    "I wanted to see if ChatGPT could plan an entire week of meals for just $50 near 4040 Walnut St in University City, Philadelphia.

    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local accuracy: ChatGPT did well with identifying real places near 4040 Walnut. It didn't make up any locations and also found a way to incorporate local philly cuisine and food trucks.\n",
    "- Math slip-up: Despite the clear prompt asking to stay under $50, the model didn‚Äôt stick to the budget. Prices were mostly reasonable per meal, but it didn‚Äôt account for the total number of meals over the week. This points to a limitation in multi-step numerical reasoning ‚Äî it can do rough meal pricing, but struggles with planning over time. I also don't know how accurate the meal prices are, as I have never seen food truck prices that average around 5 dollars, but maybe I am going to the wrong ones.\n",
    "- Formatting strength: The way it laid out the plan was helpful. It provided daily breakdowns, short descriptions, and bonus tips like checking happy hours or using student discounts."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT gave a well-formatted and localized food plan with a good variety of options around Penn‚Äôs campus. While it didn‚Äôt fully stay under the $50 constraint, it did surface relevant restaurants and organize the meals clearly. With a few adjustments (more repeat meals, skipping the splurge at White Dog), the plan could be tightened up. As-is, it‚Äôs a helpful example of ChatGPT‚Äôs potential for local planning, just don‚Äôt trust it to count every dollar for you. I would also not trust it for meal prices as explained above, I personally have never seen a 10 dollar white dog cafe 'splurge' meal, and I don't think it exists."
