    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I wanted to test a more practical use case for ChatGPT: career development. Specifically, I asked it to review my LinkedIn profile and resume—two things that students (myself included) constantly try to fine-tune but rarely get meaningful feedback on outside of the occasional career services walk-in. I wanted to see if ChatGPT could not only point out technical flaws but also make insightful recommendations that aligned with my goals in law, consulting, and public policy."

    "I provided ChatGPT with three screenshots of my entire linkedin and asked it for advice on how to improve it. It responded with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Your LinkedIn profile is already strong—it showcases excellent experience, leadership, and skills. Here are specific, high-impact suggestions to improve it even further:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Profile Banner and Headshot**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Add a professional headshot**: A clear, friendly, professional photo makes your profile far more trustworthy.\n",
    "* **Add a background banner**: Use something relevant (e.g. Penn campus, courtroom, or debate setting) to visually reinforce your identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Headline**\n",
    "\n",
    "Current: *Philosophy, Political Science, and Economics @ University of Pennsylvania*\n",

    "\n",
    "This makes you more discoverable and instantly signals your value proposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. “About” Section Improvements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your “About” section is informative but could benefit from:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stronger hook** in the first line to capture interest\n",
    "* **Bullet format** to increase readability\n",
    "* **Tie to future goals** (e.g., law, policy, consulting)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Revised Version:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a PPE student at the University of Pennsylvania, I thrive at the intersection of public policy, legal analysis, and strategic thinking.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 🔹 **Legal Experience**: At Nelson Mullins, I contributed to case strategy and litigation prep through legal research and brief drafting.\n",
    "> 🔹 **Teaching & Leadership**: As a Teaching Assistant for BEPP 2010 and Head Debate Coach at Germantown Friends, I lead discussions on public finance and empower students to become critical thinkers.\n",

    "**Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT’s LinkedIn feedback went beyond surface-level edits. It pinpointed clear gaps, missing visuals, a generic headline, and an understructured About section, and explained why they mattered to recruiters. More importantly, the advice was specific. It went section by section in my linkedin and provided specific ways I could improve each one. It also taught me about features that I never really thoguht about like the ability to upload projects and certifications. On top of that, it broke down the skills section and even explained endorsement."

    "Honestly, this is some of the best resume advice I have gotten from any source. It had a great mix of positive reinforcement and slight adjustments throughout my resume. It felt like ChatGPT had a purpose for every change/edit it suggested - it would explain how each slight change in wording could deliver a different message to recruiters. It also pointed out some things about my resume that I didn't even consider. The most noticeable one was the fact that I don't have it labeled professionally; I hadn't even thought about a small detail like that, but it is definitely something that could affect how I am perceived.

    "ChatGPT proved to a very effective tool in career prep. It provided detailed feedback on both my Linkedin and Resume that was contextualized to its specific strengths and flaws. In the realm of Linkedin it taught my multiple new features, gave me ways to rephrase certain sections, and helped me create a headliner. In terms of resume development it picked up on tons of small details that helped me improved my resume and also balanced its criticism with positive reinforcement. Overall, I will definitely continue to use ChatGPT to help me improve my resume."
