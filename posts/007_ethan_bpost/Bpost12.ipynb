    "I first asked Claude and it returned the following response:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Thoughts\n",
    "For a one-week trading competition with $100 to allocate among 10 stocks, I need to balance risk and potential returns. Since the timeframe is extremely short (1 week), I'll need to focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stocks with upcoming catalysts (earnings reports, product announcements)\n",
    "2. Stocks with high volatility that could make significant moves in a short period\n",
    "3. Technical setups that suggest imminent price movements\n",
    "4. A diversified approach across sectors with different risk profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Allocation Strategy\n",
    "Without specific stock names to choose from, I'll outline my strategic approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 40% in 2-3 high-conviction, high-volatility growth stocks with potential catalysts\n",
    "- 30% in 2-3 mid-volatility stocks with strong technical setups\n",
    "- 20% in 2-3 sector-specific stocks in trending industries\n",
    "- 10% in 1-2 contrarian plays (oversold stocks with potential for quick rebounds)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution Plan\n",
    "1. Research upcoming earnings reports and company events\n",
    "2. Analyze technical indicators for short-term momentum plays\n",
    "3. Monitor market sentiment and news closely\n",
    "4. Be prepared to reallocate quickly if market conditions change\n",
    "5. Set strict stop-losses to protect capital while maximizing upside potential\n",
    "\n",
    "For a real competition, I would need the specific 10 stock tickers to provide detailed allocation recommendations based on current market conditions, technical analysis, and upcoming catalysts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It appears Claude misunderstood the assignment, so I clarified \"You can give me the 10 stocks you think should be on the list\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# My 10 Stock Selections for One-Week Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on current market dynamics, potential catalysts, and technical setups that could generate significant movement in a one-week timeframe, here are my 10 stock selections with allocation recommendations:\n",

    "## Deep Seek\n",
    "\n",
    "Deepseek took 3 tries of prompting for it to generate one semi-responsive response. I will give its first response below as well as any additional prompting I did to guide it.\n",
    "\n",
    "First Response:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Investment Allocation Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High-Growth Stocks:** Allocate $45 each to 3 high-growth companies (e.g., Apple, Tesla, and Johnson & Pfizer).\n",
    "   - Total from high-growth stocks: $135\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mid-Growth Stocks:** Invest $50 in two additional mid-growth companies (e.g., Procter & Gamble, Bank of America).\n",
    "   - Total from mid-growth stocks: $100\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Investment:** $45 + $50 + $45 + $45 = $185 → **Error detected!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Apologies for the error. Correcting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a total budget of $100, here's the revised allocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **3 High-Growth Stocks ($5 each):** $15\n",
    "- **2 Mid-Growth Companies ($5 each):** $10\n",
    "- Remaining $80 can be allocated to other high-growth or mid-growth companies as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach may not maximize turnover effectively. A more balanced strategy would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **4 High-Growth Stocks ($3 each):** $12\n",
    "- **6 Mid-Growth Companies ($5 each):** $30\n",
    "- The remaining $58 can be used to invest in lower-growth or lower-potential companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this still doesn't align with the initial response. Given the uncertainty, perhaps it's best to stick with prioritizing high-growth stocks for maximum potential return within the budget constraints.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only did this response somehow mess up the addition it created for 100 dollars, but it also didn't give me specific examples of stocks it believes have potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "I  prompted it again with the following: \"Give me 10 specific stocks for this thought experiment.\" It responded with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively manage your investment strategy and maximize potential returns within a week, here's a structured plan based on the thought experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gather Information:** Utilize financial data from sources like stock market databases or news websites to analyze company performance metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins, and dividend payouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strategize Diversification:** Implement a diversified portfolio by investing in companies from different sectors and regions. This reduces risk and leverages the potential of various economic trends and industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Predictions:** Analyze historical data and use statistical models or machine learning algorithms to predict future stock performance, focusing on high-potential sectors and regions with consistent returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle Risks:** Develop a risk management plan that includes diversifying investments and monitoring market conditions in real-time. Consider consulting financial experts for personalized insights and strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Start Small and Gradually Expand:** Begin by investing in one company at a time to build confidence before expanding your portfolio, allowing you to test different strategies and strategies based on news events or upcoming earnings reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this structured approach, you can create a more informed and effective investment strategy that balances risk management with strategic growth.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally prompted it one last time with: \"Can you please give me 10 specific stocks you think will have the highest growth potential within a week.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It responded with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Investment Strategy:\n",
    "1. **Sector Diversification:**\n",
    "   - Focus on different sectors to spread risk and capitalize on various economic trends.\n",
    "     - **Semiconducting and Silicon-Based Companies:** Look for companies like Xilinx, Intel, and IBM.\n",
    "     - **Renewable Energy Stocks:** Consider names such as Tesla (tesla.com).\n",
    "     - **Financial Services:** Invest in companies like Capital One or HSBC.\n",
    "     - **Consumer Staples:** Focus on Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble.\n",
    "     - **Healthcare or Pharmaceuticals:** Explore Johnson & Johnson or Pfizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Focus on High-Growth Potential:**\n",
    "   - Prioritize companies with significant growth potential, especially with upcoming technologies in sectors like semiconducting electronics and renewable energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diversification Across Assets:**\n",
    "   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Monitor News and Trends:**\n",
    "   - Keep an eye on market news, economic indicators, regulatory changes, and sector-specific developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Rebalance Investments:**\n",
    "   - If any sectors or companies perform poorly, ensure your investments are adjusted to maintain diversification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Stocks (10 Specific Examples):\n",
    "1. **Xilinx Technologies Inc** - Semiconducting electronics growth.\n",
    "2. **Intel Corporation** - Semiconducting sector with strong revenue and profit growth.\n",
    "3. **Tesla Inc.** - Renewable energy potential.\n",
    "4. **Capital One Corporation** - Financial services growth.\n",
    "5. **HSBC Corporation** - Financial sector with growing opportunities.\n",
    "6. **Procter & Gamble Company** - Consumer Staples with potential economic impact.\n",
    "7. **Johnson & Johnson Company** - Healthcare sector with emerging treatments.\n",
    "8. **Pfizer Inc.** - Pharmaceuticals industry with regulatory changes.\n",
    "9. **Coca-Cola Co.** - Consumer Staples and essential products growth.\n",
    "10. **Procter & Gamble Company** - Consumer Staples and healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on these companies while diversifying your investments, you aim to achieve a decent return within just one week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only did this take 3 instances of prompting, but it also just seemed to spew out random stocks. I guess we will see if Deepseek can still pull through in a week."

On top of that, some of the stocks generated by ChatGPT were either outdated/unstrategic, despite it claiming that it was using live market data. BBBYQ is a penny stock now and can't be traded on almost any platform. Deepseek ran inton a similar more severse version of the issue - Xilinx Technologies Inc no longer exists as an individual stock you can trade - rather it was acquired under AMD in 2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this doesn't affect the quality of the portfolio - it is interesting to note that ChatGPT immediately followed the prompting and was able to adapt to the situation, while Claude and Deepseek needed multiple rounds of prompting to generate the right result. There were also some key restriction to this experiment; a one week sample size might be too short and volatile of a period to acrruately compare market knowedlege.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Claude seemed to be the most competent LLM in the realm of the stock market. Deepseek was probably the worse as it yielded a negative return and also inluded a stock for a company that had been acquired in 2022."
