    "I recently got inspired by a trend of people putting their faces onto random celebrities, so I wanted to try to see how good ChatGPT is at aging people. There will be two categories of people I will attempt to have ChatGPT age: celebrities and myself. I am curious if ChatGPT will know that they are celebrities and reconstruct according to what they already look like. Thats why I will be comparing the celebrity aging to the aging of myself."

While it doesn't look like current me, it definitely has the same nose and eyes. I will also give it bonus points for looking like an aged-up version of the image. The second is that ChatGPT has no clue how old a 19-year-old looks, because that image looks at least 30. To further test this, I am going to give ChatGPT an image of me that is both older and looks more like the current version of me.\n",

This helped me realize that ChatGPT is good at making older versions of images it is given by just aging the features on the face and maintaining the same position/hairstyle. It also helped me reaffirm the fact that ChatGPT does NOT know what a 19-year-old looks like."

    "- ChatGPT is not the best at actually making people look like their older selves. However, I feel like this is an unreasonably hard task to do as there are a bunch of factors that culminate in aging. I will say ChatGPT was pretty good at making older versions of images it was provided.\n",
    "- ChatGPT is not the most accurate at making people a specific (granted there is a lot of variance) as it consistently made a 19 year old look late 20s/early 30s.\n",
    "- Overall, ChatGPT is pretty good at recognizing celebrities - even when they are younger versions of themselves. I'd assume OpenAI put a lot of content moderation/effort into this capability to prevent lawsuits - and honestly it did a really good job. Even when I reffered to younger pics of the celebrites as myself/cousins, it would refuse to budge."
