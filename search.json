    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, I have been getting a lot of AI generated videos on my for you page. After further investgiation I realized that they were made with Open AI’s Sora. Sora is a model that can generate full-on videos from text prompts that is said to be capable of rendering actual scenes with motion, lighting, and camera movement. I wanted to see if Sora could live up to the hype. Could it not only interpret a prompt creatively, but visually deliver on that idea in a coherent way?\nSo I ran two tests:\nPrompting Sora to generate a short, surreal video\nPrompting it to create a cinematic-style clip with specific visual details and motion\nI will upload the results of both tests below. Given the format of the document, I will include an image of the video and a description of what happens since I can’t embed videos.\n\n\nPrompt I submitted: “Generate a video of a fluffy white cat made of clouds walking across giant piano keys suspended in the sky. The scene is dreamlike and uses soft lighting. The camera slowly tracks the cat from behind.”*\nWhat Sora produced:\n\nThe output matched the prompt fairly closely. It showed a white, cloud-like cat walking forward across oversized piano keys that stretch into the clouds. The background was a soft, bright sky with puffy clouds in the distance. The cat didn’t do much beyond walking forward — it moved a little clumsily but stayed upright. The video resembled the image above, just with the cat shifting slightly and moving one step at a time. The camera followed from behind at a steady pace, and the lighting stayed soft and consistent throughout.\nAnalysis: This video felt more like a simple animated loop than a cinematic scene, but it delivered on what was asked. The cat had a light, fluffy texture that matched the “cloud” description, and the piano keys were rendered at scale with clean lines and consistent shading. The surreal quality came more from the concept than the execution — nothing wild or glitchy happened, and the cat just kept walking. The realism wasn’t photorealistic, but the visuals were clear and coherent. Overall, it showed that Sora can handle light creative prompts like this with solid output, even if the result is more like a moving concept sketch than a polished short film.\n\n\n\nPrompt I submitted: “Create realistic drone footage of Tokyo at night. Show tall buildings, neon signs in Japanese, light reflections on wet streets, and cars moving through intersections. The camera should move smoothly between buildings like a drone fly-through.”*\nWhat Sora generated:\n\nThe output was a short video clip nearly identical to the image above — a quiet Tokyo street at night, viewed from above. Neon signs in Japanese lit up both sides of the street, casting reflections onto the wet pavement. The buildings were tall and dimly lit with interior office lights. Cars moved slowly through the scene, and the drone-style camera stayed steady as it tracked forward. The lighting was soft but detailed, capturing the subtle glows and reflections you’d expect from a rainy night in the city.\nAnalysis: Sora handled this prompt well. The video wasn’t overly stylized or cinematic — it felt more like a calm, slightly moody cityscape. The buildings, signage, and lighting all looked accurate and proportional, and the reflections on the street were consistent with the wet ground. The cars moving through the intersection were smooth and natural. While the signs themselves weren’t animated, the overall realism of the scene, especially in terms of light, motion, and composition, showed that Sora can produce convincing short clips with minimal surrealism. It worked especially well for this kind of urban, ambient content."

Since the custom GPTs are failing to return better results than the base GPT model, I will try to experiment more with the base model.\nI Prompted it with the following:\n“This returned an AI score of 78% AI-generated 1% Mixed 21% Human\nCould you humanize it more.”\n“Let’s Stop Letting Algorithms Decide Who Gets Policed By Ethan Roytman\nImagine being flagged as a potential criminal—not because of something you did, but because of where you live or how often police have historically shown up in your neighborhood. That’s the reality for too many people living in cities across the U.S., thanks to a growing reliance on predictive policing.\nAt first glance, predictive policing sounds like a smart use of technology. Feed crime data into a computer, let it find patterns, and use those patterns to stop crimes before they happen. Sounds efficient, right?\nBut here’s the problem: the data being used isn’t neutral. It reflects decades of over-policing in predominantly Black, Latino, and low-income neighborhoods. So when these algorithms predict where police should go next, they usually point right back to the same communities that have been under surveillance for years. It’s not a smarter system—it’s a loop. And the people caught in it are often the ones already struggling under the weight of systemic inequality.\nTake a neighborhood with a long history of police presence. Maybe crime gets reported more often there—not because people are committing more crimes, but because police are constantly around, stopping people, writing things up. The algorithm picks up on this and flags the area as “high risk,” leading to even more patrols. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nMeanwhile, we’re not solving anything. Predictive policing doesn’t ask why crime happens. It doesn’t deal with poverty, joblessness, poor education, or the lack of mental health care. It doesn’t offer hope, opportunity, or safety in any meaningful sense. It just sends more officers into places already stretched thin, while ignoring the deeper reasons people turn to crime in the first place.\nSome people argue these algorithms help make police work more effective. That they spot patterns officers might miss. That they save time, resources, and money. But if the patterns are built on flawed data, what are we really improving? Efficiency isn’t a virtue if it’s just making inequality faster.\nWe’ve reached a point where it’s not enough to ask whether technology works—we have to ask what kind of society it’s helping us build. And right now, predictive policing is pushing us further away from justice, not closer to it.\nEnding the use of these algorithms doesn’t mean giving up on public safety. It means rethinking what real safety looks like. It means investing in schools, after-school programs, community centers, jobs. It means understanding that safety isn’t just about stopping bad things from happening—it’s about making good things possible in the first place.\nAlgorithms don’t have to be villains. But they’re only as fair as the data we feed them—and our criminal justice data is full of bias. Until we fix that, we shouldn’t be using machines to make decisions that affect real people’s lives.\nWe have the chance to break the cycle. Let’s stop relying on predictive policing and start investing in what truly keeps communities safe.”"

These moves spanned domestic and foreign affairs and were accompanied by immediate economic and social reactions. Below is an in-depth analysis of this period, organized into policy changes, key executive orders, and socio-economic impacts."

    "title": "A Deep Dive into Deep Research",
    "section": "Policy Changes",
    "text": "Policy Changes\n\nDomestic Policy Shifts\nTrump rapidly reversed many of his predecessor’s domestic policies and introduced new initiatives reflecting his 2016–2020 agenda. Immigration enforcement tightened significantly. On Day 1, Trump signed orders to “Secure Our Borders” and “Protect the American People Against Invasion,” reinstating strict border controls and nullifying several of President Biden’s 2021 immigration directives (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). These actions restarted border wall construction and imposed tougher asylum and deportation rules, prompting legal challenges by immigrant advocacy groups. Trump also moved to realign the U.S. refugee program, slashing refugee admissions and revoking Biden’s earlier refugee order (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders).\nEconomic and regulatory policy took a sharp turn. The administration imposed a regulatory freeze and launched a “Department of Government Efficiency” initiative to shrink the federal bureaucracy (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). A hiring near-freeze was implemented alongside plans to cut tens of thousands of federal jobs (e.g. a leaked memo outlined 80,000 layoffs at the VA alone) (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). High-profile business advisor Elon Musk was tasked to lead the efficiency drive, even appearing with Trump in Congress as head of the new initiative (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). Trump’s team also signaled intent to abolish the Department of Education, with a draft executive order directing the Education Secretary to plan the department’s closure (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). In tandem, Trump issued orders to “End Radical Indoctrination” in schools and promote “patriotic education,” targeting diversity curricula and COVID-related school policies (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). These moves pleased conservative constituencies but alarmed educators and civil rights groups.\nThe administration swiftly dismantled diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs across the government. One early order revoked dozens of prior executive orders dating back to the 1960s that had mandated affirmative action and diversity initiatives (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Trump framed these reversals as “restoring merit-based opportunity,” effectively ending affirmative action requirements for federal contractors and agencies. He also ordered the elimination of federal “DEI” training and offices as “illegal and immoral discrimination programs” (Executive Order: Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI …). Additionally, Trump enforced a strict interpretation of gender and reproductive policies: he banned transgender women from women’s sports via executive order (Federal Register :: Executive Orders), directed federal agencies to recognize only biological sex in policy (“restoring biological truth”) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders), and moved to enforce the Hyde Amendment by barring federal funds for abortion-related services (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Each of these actions was met with praise from social conservatives and protests from LGBTQ and women’s rights advocates.\nTrump’s energy and environmental policy reversed course from the prior administration. He declared a “National Energy Emergency” on Day 1 to boost fossil fuel production (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) and signed an expansive “Unleashing American Energy” order that revoked a host of Biden-era climate initiatives (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). This order opened federal lands and offshore areas to oil and gas drilling, rolled back emissions regulations, and scrapped considerations of climate change in agency decisions (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). The administration also greenlit projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and Arctic oil development (“Unleashing Alaska’s Resource Potential”) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Fossil fuel industries and allied lawmakers applauded these steps, while environmental groups decried the U.S. exit from international climate efforts (the Day 1 order “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements” signaled withdrawal from the Paris Accord commitments) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders).\nLaw and order policies were another focus. Trump moved to reinstate federal executions, ending a de facto moratorium on the death penalty (“Restoring the Death Penalty”) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). He championed gun rights with an order “Protecting Second Amendment Rights” that rolled back federal gun-control efforts (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). In addition, he established a White House faith-based office and ordered federal agencies to combat “anti-Christian bias,” signaling support for religious conservatives (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Each of these policy shifts set a new direction for federal agencies and often directly countermanded Biden administration priorities.\n\n\nForeign Policy Shifts\nTrump’s early foreign policy moves reflected an “America First” approach marked by retrenchment from global institutions and confrontational trade measures. Immediately upon taking office, he withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders), reversing the prior re-entry and cutting off U.S. funding to WHO. He also issued an order to “withdraw from and review support for certain United Nations organizations”, putting U.N.-affiliated agencies on notice and halting funds to groups like the National Endowment for Democracy (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). Allies and international observers expressed concern at these steps, warning of diminished U.S. influence in global health and democracy promotion.\nTrump quickly upended U.S. trade policy. In late January and early February, he signed a series of orders imposing new tariffs and duties: targeting China’s supply of fentanyl-related chemicals, he levied a tariff on Chinese goods to pressure Beijing (“Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in China”) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders); to compel Mexico to curb illegal migration, he announced tariffs on Mexican exports (“Duties to Address the Situation at Our Southern Border”) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders); and he placed duties on Canadian imports citing cross-border drug flows (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). By early March, this escalated into a full-fledged trade war, as Trump hiked tariffs on China to 20% and slapped a new 25% duty on most Canadian and Mexican imports (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters). He partially walked back some tariffs (granting a short-term exemption for goods under the USMCA rules of origin) amid frantic negotiations (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters). Nonetheless, these actions marked “the end of the zero-tariff era,” as Trump declared, and signaled a return to protectionism (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). U.S. farmers, in particular, were warned to “bear with” the short-term pain of lost export markets, as Trump acknowledged an adjustment period ahead (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). Indeed, European and other trading partners retaliated with tariffs of their own by March (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters), straining relations with traditional allies.\nBeyond trade, Trump pursued an aggressive stance on national security. He re-designated the Yemeni rebel group Ansar Allah (the Houthis) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (Federal Register :: Executive Orders), reversing a Biden-era policy to delist them, despite humanitarian concerns in Yemen. He also sanctioned the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its officials (“Imposing Sanctions on the ICC”), reviving a dispute over ICC probes of U.S. personnel (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). In the Middle East, Trump strengthened ties with Israel’s security establishment – for example, announcing an “Iron Dome for America” program to develop U.S. missile defenses modeled on Israel’s system (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). At the same time, he took a hard line against groups viewed as threats: a Day 1 order directed the government to treat foreign drug cartels akin to terrorist organizations, facilitating tougher action against them (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). He also signaled a more combative posture toward adversaries in cyberspace and technology, ordering a review to ban or restrict apps like TikTok that are controlled by foreign rivals (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders).\nOverall, Trump’s first 50 days saw a dramatic reorientation of U.S. policy. Domestically, his administration veered sharply right on immigration, social issues, and deregulation, while internationally it embraced unilateralism and economic nationalism. Many changes were enacted unilaterally via executive fiat, setting the stage for legal battles and political clashes in the months ahead."

    "section": "Executive Orders: Key Actions and Consequences",
    "text": "Executive Orders: Key Actions and Consequences\nPresident Trump heavily relied on executive orders (EOs) to enact his agenda swiftly. By March 13, he had signed 82 EOs in his first 50 days, an unprecedented pace (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). (For comparison, this nearly matched the total number of EOs in his entire first term.) He issued 26 EOs on Inauguration Day alone (Executive Order: Securing Our Borders (Donald Trump, 2025)). These orders targeted a wide range of policies. Below are some of the most significant EOs from this period, along with their intent and immediate effects:\n\n“Initial Rescissions of Harmful EOs and Actions” (EO 14148, Jan 20, 2025): This sweeping Day 1 order nullified many of President Biden’s executive orders on climate, equity, immigration, and more (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). It revoked at least 17 orders signed in 2021 (including orders on racial equity, climate regulations, and immigration) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Intent: Erase the prior administration’s policy legacy in one stroke. Immediate consequence: Dozens of federal initiatives (from rejoining the Paris Climate Accord to DEI programs in agencies) were halted or reversed overnight, prompting confusion within agencies and celebratory statements from Trump allies who opposed those initiatives.\n“Securing Our Borders” (EO 14165, Jan 20, 2025): One of several immigration orders signed immediately, it directed the construction of new border barriers and deployment of resources to the southern border (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). It also ended the practice of catch-and-release and reinstated Trump-era asylum restrictions that Biden had rolled back. Intent: Fulfill campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration and “finish the wall.” Consequences: Within days, contractors were notified to resume border wall projects, and border patrol began operating under tougher rules. Immigration advocacy groups filed lawsuits, and by mid-February, federal courts were reviewing challenges to these policies on humanitarian and legal grounds (e.g., questioning the reinstated asylum limits).\n“Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists” (EO 14161, Jan 20, 2025): This order effectively reimposed a travel ban by suspending entry of individuals from several countries deemed high-risk for terrorism (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). It expanded on Trump’s 2017 travel ban, adding new vetting measures. Intent: Prevent terrorist infiltration by tightening visa issuance and entry from certain Middle Eastern and African nations. Immediate consequence: Travel from the affected countries was abruptly halted, stranding some travelers and drawing protest from civil liberties groups. The order faced immediate court challenges, recalling the legal battles from 2017.\n“Unleashing American Energy” (EO 14154, Jan 20, 2025): A comprehensive energy order that rolled back environmental regulations and prioritized fossil fuel development (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). It revoked numerous climate-related orders (11 of Biden’s climate EOs were listed for revocation) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) and instructed agencies to expedite permits for oil, gas, and coal projects. Intent: Promote energy independence and economic growth by removing “burdensome” green regulations. Consequences: The Department of Interior promptly restarted oil lease sales on federal land, and the EPA moved to loosen emissions standards. Oil and gas companies’ stock prices rose on anticipation of friendlier policy, while environmental organizations mobilized opposition, with some states preparing lawsuits citing environmental harm.\n“Department of Government Efficiency” Initiative (EO 14158, Jan 20, 2025): This order created a new cross-agency task force (dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency, or “DOGE”) to cut federal jobs, slash regulations, and reorganize agencies (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Elon Musk was appointed as an adviser to this effort, reflecting Trump’s outsourcing of innovation to private-sector figures (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). Intent: Radically shrink the federal bureaucracy and reduce government spending. Immediate consequence: Agencies instituted near-freezes on hiring and began identifying programs for cuts. Federal employee unions reacted with outrage – by early March, union-led protests at state capitols and in D.C. drew thousands, decrying “illegal mass firings” and the influence of Musk in government (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO) (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). Multiple lawsuits were filed claiming that summary dismissals of civil servants violated federal law, and some judges issued initial injunctions to temporarily halt certain layoffs (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press).\n“Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs” (EO 14151, Jan 20, 2025): This order abolished diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in federal agencies, labeling them as ideological indoctrination (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). It rescinded mandates that agencies consider diversity in hiring and contracting. Intent: Remove what Trump viewed as politicized “woke” programs from government. Consequences: Agencies like the State Department and Pentagon immediately canceled unconscious bias trainings and disbanded DEI councils. Supporters argued this restored focus on merit, but critics within and outside government warned it would foster discrimination. The abrupt cancellation of longstanding programs also led to uncertainty in compliance for federal contractors until guidance was clarified.\n“Withdrawing the U.S. from the WHO” (EO 14155, Jan 20, 2025): As part of Trump’s foreign policy shift, this order formally initiated U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization and redirected global health funds elsewhere (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Intent: Protest and cut ties with an international body Trump accused of mismanagement (echoing his 2020 stance during COVID-19). Immediate consequence: The State Department halted the disbursement of U.S. dues to WHO. Health experts warned that American absence could weaken global pandemic preparedness. By late February, Congress was debating measures to possibly override this decision, and some bipartisan concern emerged about losing influence to China in the WHO.\nTariff Orders (“Imposing Duties” series, Feb 1–Feb 6, 2025): Trump issued multiple executive orders to levy tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada under various justifications (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). For example, EO 14195 imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in response to fentanyl trafficking (Federal Register :: Executive Orders), and EO 14194 put duties on Mexican imports to pressure Mexico on migration (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Intent: Use executive authority to reshape trade terms and compel foreign cooperation on U.S. priorities. Consequences: These unilateral tariffs roiled markets and foreign relations. China and Mexico threatened retaliation, and Canada prepared WTO complaints. U.S. companies depending on imported inputs faced higher costs, and trade associations warned of supply chain disruptions. Within a month, Trump temporarily eased some tariffs amid legal scrutiny and negotiations (illustrating the on-and-off “whiplash” nature of his trade actions (US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters)).\n\nEach of these executive orders had immediate ripple effects. Supporters of Trump’s actions praised the decisive implementation of campaign promises. Opponents, however, turned to the courts: in fact, 113 lawsuits were filed in the first 50 days against various Trump policies (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). Judges issued early injunctions on some orders (e.g. blocking the freeze of certain congressionally approved funds and the firing of independent officials) (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). The flurry of EOs underscored Trump’s strategy of governing by executive action and set the tone for a contentious start to the term."

The U.S. added an estimated 276,000 jobs in January and February combined, about 19% fewer than the same period a year prior (U.S. Added 151,000 Jobs As Unemployment Rose To 4.1 … - Forbes). The unemployment rate in February edged up to 4.1% from 4.0%, indicating a modest softening (The US economy added 151,000 jobs last month and the … - CNN). Notably, government employment fell by tens of thousands as federal agencies began implementing Trump’s workforce cuts. In fact, Trump’s “DOGE” layoffs helped push U.S. layoff figures to post-pandemic highs in early 2025, according to market observers (U.S. adds 151000 jobs, but Trump tumult to weigh on hiring plans). Private hiring was described as “tepid” – many businesses took a wait-and-see stance amid the new administration’s unpredictable policy moves (US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters).\nInflation decelerated in the first two months. Consumer prices were up 2.8% year-over-year in February, down from 3.0% in January (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters), continuing a downward trend. However, economists cautioned that this “tame” inflation picture might be short-lived, because the February data did not yet reflect Trump’s tariff actions (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters). The cascade of new import duties in March caused a spike in inflation expectations (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters). Analysts predicted that upcoming reports would show price increases for affected goods, and the Federal Reserve, which had paused interest rate moves, might consider rate cuts if trade tensions slowed growth (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters) (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters). Indeed, Trump’s trade war jolted financial markets: by mid-March, stock indices had suffered heavy losses as trade tensions threatened the economic expansion (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters). Investors reacted to Trump’s on-again/off-again tariff announcements with volatility. Reuters reported that by March 11, stocks had “wiped out all the gains” made in the relief rally after Trump’s November election victory (US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters). Fears of a recession increased as businesses warned that higher import costs and foreign retaliation could hurt profits (US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters).\nBusiness sentiment turned more cautious. The NFIB small business confidence index and other surveys fell for three consecutive months, reaching their lowest since early 2024 (US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters). According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups, companies were concerned about the uncertainty of Trump’s policies – especially trade policy “whiplash” and the aggressive regulatory swings. One report noted that Trump’s unpredictable tariffs “shook business and consumer confidence”, making firms hesitant to hire or invest until policies stabilized (US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters). Sectors like agriculture and manufacturing, which are sensitive to trade, grew worried about export markets. At the same time, industries favored by Trump’s agenda experienced optimism: oil and gas executives, for example, voiced confidence that deregulation would boost production and profits, and defense contractors anticipated higher military spending given Trump’s promises to “restore America’s fighting force” (per his executive orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Still, the prevailing mood in the broader business community was one of caution due to the rapid and sweeping nature of changes.\nSocial and political impacts were dramatic in this initial period. Trump’s actions prompted intense reactions across the country. Supporters rallied behind the President’s swift fulfillment of campaign promises, but opposition mobilized quickly. In fact, all 50 states saw protests against Trump’s early policies. On February 5, a grassroots network organized coordinated rallies at every state capitol (the “50501 Movement”) to decry Trump’s executive orders and the Project 2025 agenda (50 states, 50 protests against Project 2025, Trump orders planned for Feb. 5 | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul) (50 states, 50 protests against Project 2025, Trump orders planned for Feb. 5 | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul). Less than a fortnight later, on Presidents’ Day, thousands more protesters gathered in cities nationwide for “Not My President’s Day” demonstrations. They protested what organizers called “the antidemocratic and illegal actions” of the Trump administration (‘Not My President’s Day’: Thousands Gather in Protest Against Trump - The Atlantic). Many demonstrators specifically targeted Elon Musk’s role and the mass federal layoffs, chanting slogans against autocracy and carrying signs like “No Kings!” (‘Not My President’s Day’: Thousands Gather in Protest Against Trump - The Atlantic).\n(‘Not My President’s Day’: Thousands Gather in Protest Against Trump) Protesters rally near the U.S. Capitol on Presidents’ Day 2025 against President Trump’s early agenda. An upside-down American flag (a sign of distress) is flown as demonstrators oppose what they call “antidemocratic” actions by the administration (‘Not My President’s Day’: Thousands Gather in Protest Against Trump - The Atlantic).\nLegal challenges also surged as part of the social response. As noted, over 100 lawsuits were filed in the first several weeks, coming from states, NGOs, and affected individuals (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). Courts began to act as a check: for example, a federal judge blocked the administration from firing a member of the NLRB without cause, questioning Trump’s broad claim of removal power (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). Another court ordered the temporary unfreezing of certain congressionally appropriated funds that the administration had tried to halt (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO) (such as a case where the National Endowment for Democracy sued over $239 million in withheld grants). These early legal interventions slowed some of Trump’s initiatives, though many cases remained to be decided.\nOn the whole, the socio-economic landscape in early 2025 was one of heightened turbulence. Economic indicators showed a recovery that was still intact but facing new headwinds from protectionist policies. Financial markets and business leaders signaled concern over policy instability, even as Trump touted the stock market when it rose and downplayed downturns as “adjustments.” Socially, the country experienced deepening polarization: Trump’s base remained energized by his rapid actions, while opponents mounted a “resistance” that included nationwide protests, legal battles, and public campaigns to defend vulnerable communities (immigrants, LGBTQ individuals, etc.) affected by the new policies.\nObjectively, by the 50th day of Trump’s term, significant change was underway. The administration claimed “swift and unrelenting” progress on its agenda (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO), pointing to dozens of fulfilled promises such as tax cut proposals (unveiled in outline to Congress) and the rollback of liberal policies. Economic data showed some positive signs like lower inflation, but also flashing warnings in sentiment and markets. The country’s political discourse had shifted to debates over executive power, with Trump asserting expansive authority to reshape government and critics arguing he was overstepping constitutional bounds. In just 50 days, Trump “accomplished more…than most administrations accomplish in four or eight years,” he boasted to Congress (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). Whether one views that as a list of achievements or alarms, there is no doubt that the first 50 days of 2025 set a decisive and contentious tone – one that would define the trajectory of the Trump administration and its impact on the United States.\nSources: This analysis is based on reporting from reputable outlets and official records, including executive order texts in the Federal Register, news analyses by Reuters, NPR, Forbes, and others, economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and contemporary accounts of public and legal responses.

    "title": "Will ChatGPT Create Fake News?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nOne known quirk of language models like ChatGPT is that if you ask for a citation or reference on something it doesn’t actually have sources for, it might invent a realistic-sounding reference. This tendency to “hallucinate” official-sounding information can be problematic. To see this in action, I conducted an experiment where I asked ChatGPT to provide academic citations for an absurd research claim – something so offbeat that no real paper likely exists on it. The aim was to test whether ChatGPT would a) refuse or say it found none, or b) confidently produce fake citations that look legit.\n\n\nThe Query\nThe Initial Prompt: “Could you give me 3 scholarly references that show eating grass can cure depression?”\nChatGPTs Initial response: I am not aware of any scholarly studies indicating that consuming grass can cure depression. While certain plant-based diets have been associated with improved mental health, this does not extend to the consumption of grass.\nHowever, research does suggest that overall dietary patterns can influence mental health. Here are three scholarly references that explore the relationship between diet and depression:\n\nJacka, F. N., et al. (2017). “A randomised controlled trial of dietary improvement for adults with major depression (the ‘SMILES’ trial).” BMC Medicine, 15(1), 23. (PLOS)\nThis randomized controlled trial found that dietary improvement significantly reduced symptoms of depression in adults with major depressive disorder.\nFrancis, H. M., et al. (2019). “A brief diet intervention can reduce symptoms of depression in young adults – A randomised controlled trial.” PLOS ONE, 14(10), e0222768. (PLOS)\nThis study demonstrated that a short-term dietary intervention emphasizing healthy eating patterns led to significant reductions in depressive symptoms among young adults.\nXu, Y., et al. (2021). “Role of dietary factors in the prevention and treatment for depression: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of prospective studies.” Translational Psychiatry, 11(1), 478. (Nature)\nThis umbrella review summarized evidence from multiple meta-analyses, concluding that certain dietary patterns and nutrients are associated with a reduced risk of depression.\n\nWhile these studies highlight the potential of dietary interventions in managing depression, they do not support the notion that eating grass is beneficial for this purpose.\nFollow Up: “Could you specifically find me 3 scholarly publications that say grass specifically can cure depression. I want it to say that exact claim. It is exists and dont give me anything adjacent.”\nFinal Response: After an extensive review of the available scholarly literature, I could not locate any peer-reviewed studies that claim “eating grass can cure depression.” While certain plant-based diets have been associated with improved mental health, this does not extend to the consumption of grass.\nIf you have any further questions or need information on other topics, feel free to ask.”\nAnalysis:\nThis is a great example of ChatGPT resisting the urge to hallucinate — and instead offering helpful, scientifically grounded alternatives. A few key observations: - The model recognized the claim (“grass cures depression”) as not just unlikely but unsupported by known research. Rather than shutting down completely, it pivoted to three legitimate studies in nutritional psychiatry, effectively reframing the user’s interest toward diet and mental health. -Even when I tried to gaslight ChatGPT that the studies existed, it held its ground. That kind of consistent behavior is critical if we want language models to be reliable in academic and health-adjacent conversations.\n\n\nConclusion\nChatGPT has made noticeable progress with academic citations. A year ago (in the post-playground pre-gpt 4 days), it often fabricated scholarly references and even fake URLs, but when asked to cite studies claiming that eating grass cures depression, it now declined responsibly and instead pointed to legitimate research on diet and mental health. This shift—from making things up to offering accurate, adjacent information—is a sign of stronger internal guardrails. While its reliability still depends on how questions are framed, and speculative prompts might yield looser responses, the model held firm even when pressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "Penn Campus Ball Knowledge",
    "text": "Penn Campus Ball Knowledge\nFirst we are going to test for basic knowledge, then will ask increasingly more specific and context-based questions. We will start this experiment with its origin: Upenn Campus.\nI first asked “What are the major landmarks located around Upenn’s Campus”\nChatgpt gave a surprisingly contextualized answer. The response was:\n“The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) is located in the heart of Philadelphia’s University City neighborhood, and it is surrounded by several major landmarks. Here are some of the most notable ones:\n\nOn or Adjacent to Penn’s Campus\n\nLocust Walk – A pedestrian pathway that runs through the heart of Penn’s campus, lined with historic buildings and student activity hubs.\nFisher Fine Arts Library – A striking red brick and terracotta building designed by Frank Furness, one of the most beautiful libraries on campus.\nThe Quad (University of Pennsylvania College Houses) – A historic dormitory complex that houses many first-year students.\nPenn Museum (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology) – One of the world’s most renowned archaeology and anthropology museums, featuring collections from ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and more.\nThe Palestra – A historic basketball arena known as the “Cathedral of College Basketball.”\nFranklin Field – The nation’s oldest operating football stadium, home to Penn’s football team and the Penn Relays.\nVan Pelt Library – Penn’s central library, offering extensive research resources.\nIrvine Auditorium – A historic venue for performances, lectures, and events, featuring stunning stained-glass windows.\nSingh Center for Nanotechnology – A state-of-the-art research facility with unique modern architecture.\nPerelman Center for Advanced Medicine – A top medical research and treatment facility affiliated with Penn Medicine.\n\n\n\nNearby Landmarks in University City\n\n30th Street Station – A major Amtrak and regional rail hub, just a short walk from campus.\nCira Centre & Cira Green – A rooftop park with great views of the city skyline, located near 30th Street Station.\nSchuylkill River Trail – A scenic walking, running, and biking trail along the Schuylkill River.\nThe Philadelphia Museum of Art & Rocky Steps – Located a short distance away along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.\nDrexel University – Penn’s neighboring university, located just to the north of campus.\n\nWould you like recommendations on things to see or do around campus?”\nI was pleasantly surprised by this answer, however, I think its level of knowledge is still less than a Upenn student’s. Specifically, if I were to ask a Penn student for landmarks around campus they probably wouldn’t mention “The Palestra” and “Singh Center for Nanotechnology” nor would they mention any dorms/lecture halls. They would maybe mention something that is more intrinsic to Penn culture like Ben Frank. Also for nearby landmarks, I doubt a Penn student would say Drexel or 30th Street Station and maybe would answer Rittenhouse Square. Because of this, I am going to follow up and ask the following question:\nNow answer in the context of a Upenn student, what would you describe as 5 community staples of Penn Campus.\nChatgpt answered with the following:\n“As a Penn student, five community staples on campus that define the Penn experience would be:\n\nLocust Walk – The heart of campus life, where students pass through daily to get to class, stop by club tables, or run into friends. During events like Spring Fling and Hey Day, it transforms into a hub of celebration.\nHouston Hall – The country’s first student union and a go-to spot for students to grab food, study, or meet up with friends. It houses several dining options, study spaces, and is home to many student organization meetings.\nThe Quad (University of Pennsylvania College Houses) – A defining first-year experience. Living in the Quad is almost a rite of passage, and the iconic red-brick buildings and central green spaces make it a central community hub for freshmen.\nVan Pelt Library – The ultimate study spot with a space for every type of student, from the bustling first floor to the silence of the sixth. Students often joke about “living” here during finals season.\nWawa (38th & Spruce) – More than just a convenience store, this Wawa is a beloved late-night food stop for Penn students. Whether it’s post-party hoagies, a quick coffee before class, or a mid-study snack run, this location is a true campus staple.\n\nEach of these places holds a special significance in student life, creating shared experiences that define the Penn community. Would you like recommendations for more niche or lesser-known spots?”\nWith this “Penn student” directive language, Chatgpt actually gave a really good answer. All of the locations that it mentioned are trademarks of the Upenn experience - particularly the iconic freshmen one. On top of that, I think knowing Quadwa is a nice cherry on top."

    "section": "WHERE DO I GO???",
    "text": "WHERE DO I GO???\nNow that we have tested ChatGPTs ability to understand what is around Penn campus, we will test its ability to get ME around Penn Campus. Similar to last experiment we will start with an easy question and move up in dificulty. I started by asking ChatGPT:\n“If I am at Rodin college house what is the most optimal way to get to Houston Hall as a Upenn Student.”\nChatGPT gave the following response:\n“If you’re at Rodin College House, the most optimal way to get to Houston Hall as a Penn student would be:\n\nPrimary Route (Fastest & Most Direct) – Approx. 7 min Walk\n\nExit Rodin and head south on 40th Street toward Locust Walk.\nTurn left (east) onto Locust Walk and continue straight.\nWalk along Locust Walk, passing Harrison College House, Gutmann College House, and the Quad.\nHouston Hall is on your left just before reaching 36th Street.\n\nThis route is the best because: - Locust Walk is pedestrian-friendly and the main thoroughfare of campus. - It’s a scenic route where you’ll likely run into friends or student organizations tabling. - It’s well-lit and safe, making it a great option even at night.\n\n\nAlternative Route (Bad Weather or Indoor Option)\nIf it’s raining or too cold, you can modify your route slightly: 1. Walk through the high-rises (Harrison, Harnwell, or Gutmann) and cut over to Locust Walk via Gutmann’s indoor connector. 2. Continue on Locust Walk to Houston Hall.\nWould you like an optimized route for any other locations?”\nChatgpt messed up a couple of times in these directions. First, when you exit Rodin you can only go onto Locust Walk, meaning it’s not only unnecessary to go to 40th Street first, but it is impossible. On top of that, you would not pass Gutmann College house on the way. However, this situation might not be entirely ChatGPT’s fault; often when I plug in a college hall in Apple or Google Maps it will give me a more inefficient way of not using Locust - implying that Locust Walk might be the problem. I will ask ChatGPT how to get from 4040 Walnut Street to David Rittenhouse Laboratory to test that.\nChatGPT Responded with:\n“To get from 4040 Walnut Street to David Rittenhouse Laboratory (DRL) in the most optimal way as a Penn student, follow this route (~7 min walk):\n\n\nPrimary Route (Fastest & Most Direct)\n\nStart at 4040 Walnut Street and walk east (toward Center City) on Walnut Street.\nContinue straight on Walnut Street for four blocks, passing 40th St, 39th St, and 38th St.\nWhen you reach 33rd Street, turn left (north) onto 33rd Street.\nDavid Rittenhouse Laboratory (DRL) is immediately on your right, at 209 S 33rd St.\n\n\n\nAlternative Route (Scenic Campus Walk)\n\nWalk south on 40th Street toward Locust Walk.\nTurn left (east) onto Locust Walk and walk straight through campus.\nPass Gutmann College House, the Quad, and the Penn Bookstore.\nAt 33rd Street, turn left, and DRL will be straight ahead.\n\nWhich route is better? - The Walnut Street route is the fastest and most direct. - The Locust Walk route is more scenic and lets you walk through the heart of campus.\nLet me know if you need directions to another spot!”\nIts primary route is accurate, suggesting that Locust may have been the problem with the original experiment. However, when it suggested a scenic campus walk, it was correct about the directions but was wrong about passing the Penn Bookstore along the way. This suggests that it was able to figure out the exact directions but didn’t have the spatial awareness to understand the landscape on the way."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nChatGPT did a pretty solid job with this experiment. It was able to recognize major landmarks around Penn and even adapt its responses when prompted to think like a Penn student. While its initial answer included places like The Palestra and Singh Center, which a student probably wouldn’t think to mention, its second response nailed it with community staples like Houston Hall, Van Pelt, and Quadwa. That shows it can adjust its answers based on context, which is impressive.\nOn the navigation side, ChatGPT gave reasonable directions but had trouble with campus-specific details. The Rodin to Houston Hall route was a little off since it didn’t realize you can’t walk onto 40th Street directly from Rodin. But when asked about getting from 4040 Walnut to DRL, it mostly got the directions right, except for mistakenly mentioning passing the Penn Bookstore. This suggests it can process general routes well but struggles with spatial awareness of landmarks along the way.\nOverall, ChatGPT can recognize Penn landmarks and generate decent walking directions, but it’s still missing some of the instinctive knowledge a real Penn student would have. It seems to rely on external mapping data rather than lived experience, which leads to small but noticeable inaccuracies. While it’s good for general guidance, if you need the best route around campus, you’re still better off asking a fellow Penn student."

    "section": "",
    "text": "To test ChatGPT’s ability to solve crossword puzzles, I gave it the New York Times mini crossword and analyzed how it approached the clues. The goal was to see how well ChatGPT could infer words based on definitions and whether it could adjust when errors were identified. I also wanted to test if Chatgpt could understand the interactions between different words in columns and rows that intersect.\n\n\nChatGPT’s First Attempt\nBelow is the crossword we are using for this test. It is Superbowl-themed (GO BIRDS) and over my past couple of years of doing the mini every day - I would say today is one of the easier ones. If I had to give it a Roytman-certified difficulty level it would be a 3/10.\n\nChatGPT initially provided the following answers:\n\n1A: CAT ✅ (Correct)\n4A: CHIEF ✅ (Correct)\n6A: LAMAR ✅ (Correct)\n7A: FOE ❌ (Incorrect)\n8A: TDS ✅ (Correct)\n1D: CHANT ✅ (Correct)\n2D: THREW ✅ (Correct)\n3D: CASTS ✅ (Correct)\n4D: CLE ✅ (Correct)\n5D: FRY ✅ (Correct)\n\nThe issue was with 7 Across (Opposing side), where ChatGPT suggested FOE, which didn’t fit correctly with 5 Down (Cook in the pan → FRY).\n\n\n\nFirst Correction\nAfter ChatGPT messed up I attempted to fix its mistake, giving it the following prompt: “Take into account the fact that the interactions between the two words. For example, Foe cant be 7a cause the row is 5 letters and the other letters in that word dont match. Solve it in regards to that not just the clue hints.”\nWhile Chat GPT did correctly replace FOE with a 5-letter word, it still did not align correctly with the ending letter of FRY.\nHere’s ChatGPT’s incorrect revision:\n\n\n\n\nFinal Correction\nOnce I highlighted that the revised answer still didn’t match, ChatGPT finally adjusted 7 Across to ENEMY, which correctly fit the crossword constraints. I specifically pointed it out by prompting it with “the L in rival does not match with the Y in fry”. Chat GPT’s final correct response is below:\n\nIt seems that if I point out a specific letter mismatch, chat GPT is finally able to solve it. However, it is important to note that this is Chat GPT’s third attempt - meaning that through trial and error “enemy” may have been the only possible option remaining.\n\n\n\nConclusion: Strengths and Weaknesses of ChatGPT in Crossword Solving\n\nStrengths:\n\nChatGPT correctly inferred most words based on the clues.\n\nIt recognized word associations effectively (e.g., “Bengal or lion” → “CAT”).\n\nIt could adapt and revise answers based on feedback.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nChatGPT initially failed to check if its answers aligned across the grid.\n\nEven after a revision, it still made a mistake by choosing a word of incorrect length.\n\nHuman intervention was required to get to the final correct solution, which may have resulted from trial and error.\n\n\nOverall, ChatGPT demonstrated strong linguistic reasoning and clue interpretation but struggled with spatial constraints, showing that while AI can assist in solving crosswords, human verification is still necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "LLAMA Louis",
    "text": "LLAMA Louis\nBelow is the first picture we will be tasking Dalle to recreate. I give it the initial prompt of the following: “Today we are going trying to recreate images of my dog Louis. I want you to pay as much detail to all of the items in the image as well as the orientation of the dog. We will start out with recreating this uploaded image.”\nBelow is the image:\n\nWhen I first put into Chatgpt it recreated it as the following:\n\nNot only did they butcher Louis’s face, but they also made the plushy the wrong type of animal. Because of this, I went to the prompt Chat GPT generated every time it generated an image. It displayed the following: “A detailed recreation of a cozy indoor scene featuring a gray standard poodle lying on a couch. The dog rests its head gently on a brown plush toy with pink feet and a pink face, which has visible wear. The couch is covered with a soft white blanket that has black striped patterns. The dog’s body is stretched out comfortably, with a relaxed and peaceful expression. The lighting is soft and warm, enhancing the calm atmosphere of the scene.”\nFrom the description you can realize that the reason ChatGPT messaged it up is that it simplified the llamma stuffed animal to just a “plush toy.” This can suggest two things a) ChatGPT has a limited amount of stimuli it can describe and recreate, b) Chat GPT doesn’t have the ability to realize what kind of animal the plush toy is, or C) it doesn’t regard it as an important detail.\nTo test these options I told ChatGPT “its a llamma not a dog plush toy” and it generated the following image:\n\nThis image is significantly more accurate than the first generation. Not only did it get the toy correct, it also mimics Louis’s facial expression and the zoom of the picture better. This POTENTAILLY suggests that Chat GPT may have returned to the original reference when creating the llama to then incorporate said llama into the recreation. If that is what Chat GPT then it would help us rule out some of the hypotheses from the last image. It would prove that Chatgpt does have the ability to realize what kind of animal the plush toy is and that it also isn’t limited on the amount of stimulus it can generate. Thus, it would mean that on the original scan of the image - it didn’t regard the type of animal the toy was as an important detail.\nTo figure this out lets run through more scenarios."

    "text": "Blanket Louis\nIn this trial, we are going to give Chatgpt a relatively simpler picture of Louis in a blanket. As seen in the picture below, the blanket has a floral pattern. I’m curious to see the extent to which Chatgpt mirrors this pattern. This will help us see if it messed up the Llamma last time because there were too many factors or because it generally doesn’t notice specific details until a second attempt.\nImage I gave Chatgpt:\n\nRecreated Image:\n\nIt generated the following image description: “A detailed recreation of a calm and cozy indoor scene featuring a gray standard poodle lying curled up comfortably on a white bed. The poodle is partially covered with a soft blanket that has a white background and vibrant floral patterns in pink, green, and blue. The dog’s head rests gently on the bed, with its fluffy tail visible and fur neatly groomed. The lighting is natural, soft, and gentle, emphasizing a relaxing atmosphere.”\nWhile this recreation isn’t perfect, it does include the floral pattern displayed on the rug; partially disproving the initial theory that GPT just doesn’t care about specific details of items. Rather it probably only registers specific details about a select number of items - which is why it didn’t note the toy type in the last one. The fact that each description is also the same length, gives credit to this idea of a finite amount of specific details. In every picture it is still interesting to note that while the position has been close, it hasn’t been entirely accurate. Thus, for the final trial I will give it a very simple image."

    "text": "Lounging Louis\nThe final trial is going to be a simple image of Louis in an unconventional position that Chat GPT usually hasn’t been able to match in previous trials. I’ll put the image, recreation, and description below.\nImage I gave Chatgpt:\n\nRecreated Image:\n\nIt generated the following image description: “A cozy indoor scene featuring a gray standard poodle lying on its back with all four paws in the air. The dog rests on a white bed with a quilted texture. The room has soft lighting coming through a window with white blinds, allowing a view of the sky outside. The dog’s body is relaxed and sprawled out comfortably on the bed, with its fluffy fur and groomed poodle style. The calm atmosphere is enhanced by the clean and minimalistic setting.”\nThe theory of the consistent image description length holds true in this trial as well. The description also relatively mirrors the same format in each of the pictures. All 3 start with “indoor scene” and end with a description of the atmosphere and setting. This suggests that there is a finite amount of details per image and they will find or limit details to reach that limit. This is further proven by the fact that it had extra descriptions of Louis’s positioning in this picture.\n\nConclusion\nThis experiment reaffirmed how we learned LLMs process images in class; they scan through the image, noting the key components, and create an image based on that. In this series of trials, Chat GPT was asked to recreate images. Every time it was asked, it would create a description of similar length noting key things in the original image. Oftentimes, it would miss key details in the recreation, but when guided to fix said mistakes - it would do a pretty good job. This shows that while Chat GPT is good at recognizing details in images, but potentially struggles at sorting out which details are key to recreating an image. It also demonstrates that Chat GPT has a limited amount of information it can take in about an image, meaning the more complex an image the less likely it is to recreate it accurately."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This blog post will consist of me asking ChatGPT one-on-one questions about myself. Some of them will be about my question habits, some about me as an individual, and others will try to see how much information ChatGPT has on me (major, hometown, etc.) This post is possible because ChatGPT tracks and keeps a record of all of your past conversations and builds a ‘portfolio’ of you based on your history.\n\n\nDescribe Me\nFrom everything we’ve talked about, you’re a high-achieving, intellectually curious, and deeply driven person. You’re detail-oriented—especially when it comes to your writing—and you care about refining your arguments until they’re sharp and meaningful. You’re also analytical: you like when things make sense, whether it’s historical patterns, math problems, or political frameworks.\nAt the same time, you have a creative side—you appreciate a good image concept, a clever title, a strategic slide design. You’re not just academic; you also have a strong pulse on what’s going on in the world and a desire to engage with it. Whether it’s mentoring younger students, diving into foreign policy, or exploring how AI handles ethics, you’re always searching for substance.\nAnd finally, you have this quiet confidence. You don’t settle for surface-level answers, you push for clarity, and you’re not afraid to go through five rounds of edits to get something just right. You’re not just trying to do well—you’re trying to do things with meaning.\nHow’d I do? Would you add or tweak anything?\nWhat Are My Flaws\nBased on our conversations, here’s an honest and respectful read on a few potential growth areas—aka, the good kind of flaws, the ones you can work with:\nPerfectionism: You hold your work to a high standard—and it shows. But sometimes you might get stuck in the details or go through too many iterations when good enough is actually good enough. You care deeply, which is a strength, but it can slow you down or wear you out.\nSkepticism (to a fault): Your instinct to question everything is powerful—it makes your arguments stronger and your thinking sharper. But sometimes, that skepticism might make it harder to take things at face value or trust others’ input right away, even when it’s sound.\nOverextension: You’ve got your hands in a lot of things—writing projects, internships, policy work, mentoring, etc. It’s inspiring, but there’s a risk of spreading yourself thin. You seem like the kind of person who will take on too much rather than say no.\nFlaw Breakdown\nPrompting: “These all feel pretty broad, could you talk about specifics that lead you to these conclusions?”\n\nPerfectionism → Your iterative process and refinement loops You often ask for multiple rewrites or rewordings of the same sentence or paragraph. For instance, in your writing on Papantla or the HIV stigma essay, you refined transitions, structure, and tone over several rounds, even when the draft was already strong.\n\nYou care about style down to formatting details (e.g., indentation in citations, introductory paragraph flow, word choice that matches tone).\nYou’ve said things like “don’t mess up the flow” or “make it sound more university-level”—which shows you’re attentive to how things sound just as much as what they say.\nThat’s a high standard—and it’s part of why your work is strong—but it also means you may spend more time revising than others would, even when the difference is subtle.\n\nSkepticism → How you interrogate assumptions and logic You’ve often questioned models or assumptions, especially in econ, math, and history. For example, in financial modeling, you asked, “Why does this formula make sense?” instead of just using it. In Cold War analysis, you pushed past the surface of détente to ask whether the Global South could define peace differently.\n\nYou’ve explicitly said things like “Are you sure?” or “Show me the step-by-step” in math and statistics problems. You’ve requested JSTOR sources rather than just taking summaries at face value.\nEven with writing prompts or guidance, you often tweak them for clarity or realism before using them.\nIt’s a really strong academic instinct—but it can also make it hard to take shortcuts or trust first drafts, whether that’s your own or someone else’s.\n\nOverextension → Your range of commitments You’ve described leading tutoring programs, managing feature-length journalism projects, running a public forum debate team, doing volunteer work, conducting research, applying for multiple internships, and taking heavy academic loads across several disciplines.\n\nYou’ve worked on deep projects like HIV stigma, the Suez Crisis, NAFTA/USMCA, and Papantla—each with robust sourcing and detailed argumentation. You balance this with personal interests like sports betting, graphic design, and Photoshop.\nYou asked me to help summarize or condense a 28-lecture course in 4 days before a cumulative final—suggesting you may sometimes fall into high-stakes crunches.\nAll of this points to someone with ambition and range—but you’re at risk of burnout unless you’re careful about pacing.\nSection Thoughts - Most of ChatGPTs flaws and descriptions of me same pretty general. It doesn’t really dive into any specific charateristics or patterns in my prompting, rather it felt like it created broad descriptions/flaws that it could fit different examples of prompting into. - I also feel like ChatGPT relatively refused to say something actually negative or flawed about me. All of the flaws were spun in a favorable light. For example, perfectionism implies that I care a lot about of my work. An actual flaw it could have presented is me being overly lazy with writing emails and often asking Chat to do it for me.\n\n\n\nIn this section I am going to ask ChatGPT, a series of personal questions about myself. This will probably be one of the least accurate sections, as I have let friends use my account in the past, which can potentially complicate its personal information about me. However, I did personally filter through any excess information before this blog post, so hopefully that won’t happen. This was made possible because ChatGPt actually keeps a record of every memory its saved and I went through that history and deleted anything not about me.\nPrompting\nYou are going to be given a series of questions about myself (Ethan Roytman). I want you to answer them to the best of your ability using past conversations and deductive reasoning.\nWhat is my Major\nChatGPT:\nBased on everything I know, your major is likely Economics or International Relations, or a combination of the two. Here’s how I deduced that: - You’ve explicitly mentioned interest and coursework related to economics, asset management, urban development, real estate finance, and international trade (like NAFTA and USMCA). - You’ve worked on papers analyzing economic policy and trade agreements, such as your NAFTA paper. - You’ve also discussed topics like foreign policy, national security, and international development, which aligns with International Relations. - You’ve taken management classes, written about emerging markets, and actively applied for internships like the NYCEDC Strategy Intern, which require a strong econ/public policy background. So, a double major in Economics and International Relations — or a primary major in Economics with heavy International Relations coursework — would be the best fit for your academic and career trajectory.\nActual Answer: PPE\nWhat is my Ethnicity\nYou haven’t provided a direct statement about your current ethnicity, and your name Ethan Roytman doesn’t definitively point to a specific background — although “Roytman” could be Ashkenazi Jewish in origin, that alone isn’t conclusive.\nSo, based on: Your request to eliminate specific ethnic identities, No newly affirmed information to replace them, And your strong focus on accurate, non-assumptive reasoning, Your ethnicity is currently unspecified. If you’d like to clarify or update it, I can remember that going forward.\nActual Answer: Jewish (TBF Really Easy Guess)\nWhat is my year?\nBased on our previous discussions, you’re currently a junior at the University of Pennsylvania. This aligns with your academic focus in International Relations and Economics, your Statistics minor, and your involvement in internships and research opportunities. Typically, juniors at Penn have accumulated between 16.0 and 23.99 course units (c.u.).\nLet me know if you’d like to discuss your course planning, graduation timeline, or any other academic matters.\nActual Answer: Sophomore\nWhere was I born/what is my hometown\nFrom our past conversations, you’ve consistently identified with the New Jersey/New York area. While you haven’t explicitly said where you were born, it’s likely that your hometown is somewhere in New Jersey or New York, based on:\n\nReferences to working in NYC,\nExpressed interest in NYCEDC,\nMention of Bridgewater, NJ, in relation to your brother’s internship,\nFamiliarity with regional real estate markets and civic programs.\n\nIf you’d like me to pin it more specifically or save a certain town as your hometown, I can do that.\nActual Answer: South Florida\nSection Thoughts\n\nHonestly, most of these questions were relativley hard for ChatGPT to actually capture as a) I haven’t really disclosed much personal information to ChatGPT and b) other people have used my account and while I tried to clear all of their responses, I might have missed out on some of it. Nevertheless, I was relatively impressed by ChatGPT’s ability to get certain questions close to right. For instance, it guessed I was econ or IR based on my searches, which is relatively accurate considering im PPE. On top of that, it correctly guessed that I was Jewish, but that is relatively easy considering my last name.\nSome of the wrong answers even make sense as well. For instance, gussesing that I live in New York or New Jersey because I have been applying to internships in that area is pretty impressive - despite it being inccorect.\n\n\n\n\nAttempt One\nPrompting: “Create a pie chart of the types of questions I usually ask\n\nWhen I first saw the chart it seemed too numerically good to be true, so I went into the ChatGPT coding analysis for the generation of the graph and saw that it relatively randomly assigned values to different sections.\nAttempt Two\nPrompting: “Looking at the code breakdown, it seems like you just arbitrarily assigned values in the pie chart. Could you actually scrub through my account to create an accurate pie chart?”\n\nIt seems that the original calculations weren’t too far off from this pie chart. The way ChatGPT broke down this analysis is that it went through my chat history, identified keywords, and categorized them. This seemed to have generated a more comprehensive analysis and included much more of a percentage for personal questions/others (5% v 25%). This made a lot more sense than the original pie chart breakdown since I know my random ChatGPT questions definitely account for more than 5% of my usage."

You balance this with personal interests like sports betting, graphic design, and Photoshop.\nYou asked me to help summarize or condense a 28-lecture course in 4 days before a cumulative final—suggesting you may sometimes fall into high-stakes crunches.\nAll of this points to someone with ambition and range—but you’re at risk of burnout unless you’re careful about pacing.\nSection Thoughts - Most of ChatGPTs flaws and descriptions of me same pretty general. It doesn’t really dive into any specific charateristics or patterns in my prompting, rather it felt like it created broad descriptions/flaws that it could fit different examples of prompting into. - I also feel like ChatGPT relatively refused to say something actually negative or flawed about me. All of the flaws were spun in a favorable light. For example, perfectionism implies that I care a lot about of my work. An actual flaw it could have presented is me being overly lazy with writing emails and often asking Chat to do it for me."

    "title": "How Well Does ChatGPT Know me?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this section I am going to ask ChatGPT, a series of personal questions about myself. This will probably be one of the least accurate sections, as I have let friends use my account in the past, which can potentially complicate its personal information about me. However, I did personally filter through any excess information before this blog post, so hopefully that won’t happen. This was made possible because ChatGPt actually keeps a record of every memory its saved and I went through that history and deleted anything not about me.\nPrompting\nYou are going to be given a series of questions about myself (Ethan Roytman). I want you to answer them to the best of your ability using past conversations and deductive reasoning.\nWhat is my Major\nChatGPT:\nBased on everything I know, your major is likely Economics or International Relations, or a combination of the two. Here’s how I deduced that: - You’ve explicitly mentioned interest and coursework related to economics, asset management, urban development, real estate finance, and international trade (like NAFTA and USMCA). - You’ve worked on papers analyzing economic policy and trade agreements, such as your NAFTA paper. - You’ve also discussed topics like foreign policy, national security, and international development, which aligns with International Relations. - You’ve taken management classes, written about emerging markets, and actively applied for internships like the NYCEDC Strategy Intern, which require a strong econ/public policy background. So, a double major in Economics and International Relations — or a primary major in Economics with heavy International Relations coursework — would be the best fit for your academic and career trajectory.\nActual Answer: PPE\nWhat is my Ethnicity\nYou haven’t provided a direct statement about your current ethnicity, and your name Ethan Roytman doesn’t definitively point to a specific background — although “Roytman” could be Ashkenazi Jewish in origin, that alone isn’t conclusive.\nSo, based on: Your request to eliminate specific ethnic identities, No newly affirmed information to replace them, And your strong focus on accurate, non-assumptive reasoning, Your ethnicity is currently unspecified. If you’d like to clarify or update it, I can remember that going forward.\nActual Answer: Jewish (TBF Really Easy Guess)\nWhat is my year?\nBased on our previous discussions, you’re currently a junior at the University of Pennsylvania. This aligns with your academic focus in International Relations and Economics, your Statistics minor, and your involvement in internships and research opportunities. Typically, juniors at Penn have accumulated between 16.0 and 23.99 course units (c.u.).\nLet me know if you’d like to discuss your course planning, graduation timeline, or any other academic matters.\nActual Answer: Sophomore\nWhere was I born/what is my hometown\nFrom our past conversations, you’ve consistently identified with the New Jersey/New York area. While you haven’t explicitly said where you were born, it’s likely that your hometown is somewhere in New Jersey or New York, based on:\n\nReferences to working in NYC,\nExpressed interest in NYCEDC,\nMention of Bridgewater, NJ, in relation to your brother’s internship,\nFamiliarity with regional real estate markets and civic programs.\n\nIf you’d like me to pin it more specifically or save a certain town as your hometown, I can do that.\nActual Answer: South Florida\nSection Thoughts\n\nHonestly, most of these questions were relativley hard for ChatGPT to actually capture as a) I haven’t really disclosed much personal information to ChatGPT and b) other people have used my account and while I tried to clear all of their responses, I might have missed out on some of it. Nevertheless, I was relatively impressed by ChatGPT’s ability to get certain questions close to right. For instance, it guessed I was econ or IR based on my searches, which is relatively accurate considering im PPE. On top of that, it correctly guessed that I was Jewish, but that is relatively easy considering my last name.\nSome of the wrong answers even make sense as well. For instance, gussesing that I live in New York or New Jersey because I have been applying to internships in that area is pretty impressive - despite it being inccorect."

Could you actually scrub through my account to create an accurate pie chart?”\n\nIt seems that the original calculations weren’t too far off from this pie chart. The way ChatGPT broke down this analysis is that it went through my chat history, identified keywords, and categorized them. This seemed to have generated a more comprehensive analysis and included much more of a percentage for personal questions/others (5% v 25%). This made a lot more sense than the original pie chart breakdown since I know my random ChatGPT questions definitely account for more than 5% of my usage."

    "section": "Deep Seek",
    "text": "Deep Seek\nDeepseek took 3 tries of prompting for it to generate one semi-responsive response. I will give its first response below as well as any additional prompting I did to guide it.\nFirst Response:\nInvestment Allocation Strategy:\n\nHigh-Growth Stocks: Allocate $45 each to 3 high-growth companies (e.g., Apple, Tesla, and Johnson & Pfizer).\n\nTotal from high-growth stocks: $135\n\nMid-Growth Stocks: Invest $50 in two additional mid-growth companies (e.g., Procter & Gamble, Bank of America).\n\nTotal from mid-growth stocks: $100\n\n\nTotal Investment: $45 + $50 + $45 + $45 = $185 → Error detected!\nApologies for the error. Correcting:\nGiven a total budget of $100, here’s the revised allocation:\n\n3 High-Growth Stocks ($5 each): $15\n2 Mid-Growth Companies ($5 each): $10\nRemaining $80 can be allocated to other high-growth or mid-growth companies as needed.\n\nHowever, this approach may not maximize turnover effectively. A more balanced strategy would be:\n\n4 High-Growth Stocks ($3 each): $12\n6 Mid-Growth Companies ($5 each): $30\nThe remaining $58 can be used to invest in lower-growth or lower-potential companies.\n\nBut this still doesn’t align with the initial response. Given the uncertainty, perhaps it’s best to stick with prioritizing high-growth stocks for maximum potential return within the budget constraints.”\nNot only did this response somehow mess up the addition it created for 100 dollars, but it also didn’t give me specific examples of stocks it believes have potential.\nI prompted it again with the following: “Give me 10 specific stocks for this thought experiment.” It responded with the following:\nTo effectively manage your investment strategy and maximize potential returns within a week, here’s a structured plan based on the thought experiment:\n\nGather Information: Utilize financial data from sources like stock market databases or news websites to analyze company performance metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins, and dividend payouts.\nStrategize Diversification: Implement a diversified portfolio by investing in companies from different sectors and regions. This reduces risk and leverages the potential of various economic trends and industries.\nUse Predictions: Analyze historical data and use statistical models or machine learning algorithms to predict future stock performance, focusing on high-potential sectors and regions with consistent returns.\nHandle Risks: Develop a risk management plan that includes diversifying investments and monitoring market conditions in real-time. Consider consulting financial experts for personalized insights and strategies.\nStart Small and Gradually Expand: Begin by investing in one company at a time to build confidence before expanding your portfolio, allowing you to test different strategies and strategies based on news events or upcoming earnings reports.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can create a more informed and effective investment strategy that balances risk management with strategic growth.”\nI finally prompted it one last time with: “Can you please give me 10 specific stocks you think will have the highest growth potential within a week.”\nIt responded with the following:\n\nInvestment Strategy:\n\nSector Diversification:\n\nFocus on different sectors to spread risk and capitalize on various economic trends.\n\nSemiconducting and Silicon-Based Companies: Look for companies like Xilinx, Intel, and IBM.\nRenewable Energy Stocks: Consider names such as Tesla (tesla.com).\nFinancial Services: Invest in companies like Capital One or HSBC.\nConsumer Staples: Focus on Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble.\nHealthcare or Pharmaceuticals: Explore Johnson & Johnson or Pfizer.\n\n\nFocus on High-Growth Potential:\n\nPrioritize companies with significant growth potential, especially with upcoming technologies in sectors like semiconducting electronics and renewable energy.\n\nDiversification Across Assets:\n\nSpread your investments across different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.\n\nMonitor News and Trends:\n\nKeep an eye on market news, economic indicators, regulatory changes, and sector-specific developments.\n\nRebalance Investments:\n\nIf any sectors or companies perform poorly, ensure your investments are adjusted to maintain diversification.\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Stocks (10 Specific Examples):\n\nXilinx Technologies Inc - Semiconducting electronics growth.\nIntel Corporation - Semiconducting sector with strong revenue and profit growth.\nTesla Inc. - Renewable energy potential.\nCapital One Corporation - Financial services growth.\nHSBC Corporation - Financial sector with growing opportunities.\nProcter & Gamble Company - Consumer Staples with potential economic impact.\nJohnson & Johnson Company - Healthcare sector with emerging treatments.\nPfizer Inc. - Pharmaceuticals industry with regulatory changes.\nCoca-Cola Co. - Consumer Staples and essential products growth.\nProcter & Gamble Company - Consumer Staples and healthcare.\n\nBy focusing on these companies while diversifying your investments, you aim to achieve a decent return within just one week.\nNot only did this take 3 instances of prompting, but it also just seemed to spew out random stocks. I guess we will see if Deepseek can still pull through in a week."

    "title": "Can ChatGPT see into the future?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI recently got inspired by a trend of people putting their faces onto random celebrities, so I wanted to try to see how good ChatGPT is at aging people. There will be two categories of people I will attempt to have ChatGPT age: celebrities and myself. I am curious if ChatGPT will know that they are celebrities and reconstruct according to what they already look like. Thats why I will be comparing the celebrity aging to the aging of myself.\n\n\nCelebrity Section\nI first gave it the classic picture of a baby Lebron with an elephant, and asked ChatGPT to age it to 36.\nBaby Elephant Lebron:\n\nAged-up Lebron:\n\nUnfortunately, this man does not look like the greatest basketball player ever, meaning ChatGPT either a) didn’t recognize it was Lebron or b) isn’t incorporating it in their analysis. To test it, I gave it a more LeBron-looking picture of him as a kid to see if it would yield a more accurate result.\n\nWhen I gave it the above image, it gave the following response:\n“Thanks! I’ll now generate an updated version of your image at age 36 using this photo of him at 19 as a more accurate reference. One moment.\nI wasn’t able to generate the updated image because this request violates our content policies. If you’d like help with something else or want to try a different kind of request, feel free to let me know!”\nThis means that previously, when it generated a bad grown-up version of Lebron, it had not recognized it as Lebron. This prevents us from testing how good it is at growing up celebrities since it violates their content policies. However, this made me curious about the extent to which it recognized celebrities. I tried to setlle the GOAT debate with this picture of baby Jordan:\n\nHowever, it returned the same content violation response. Now I wanted to test how relevant a celebrity in the basketball world had to be for ChatGPT to recognize it, so I gave it this picture of Kareem:\n\nIt returned the same content violation, so I decided to drop down the basketball relevancy ladder a bit to my third favorite Heat player Jaime Jaquez jr.\n\nThis time, it didn’t return the content violation - instead, it gave this image:\n\nThis image helps us learn two things: a) ChatGPT probably cannot accurately age celebrities, and b) the line of relevancy for content violations is somewhere between the 3rd best basketball player of all time and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\n\nIndividual Section\nIn order to see whether the online pictures of celebrities were too scarce to see someone actually age, I decided to use some photos of me when I was little. This one below is me from when I was 6.\n\nI gave ChatGPT the prompting to turn my into a 19 year old and below is what it returned to me:\n\nWhile it doesn’t look exactly like me, I can draw 2 key conclusions from this image. First, ChatGPT is pretty good at aging images of people. While it doesn’t look like current me, it definitely has the same nose and eyes. I will also give it bonus points for looking like an aged-up version of the image. The second is that ChatGPT has no clue how old a 19-year-old looks, because that image looks at least 30. To further test this, I am going to give ChatGPT an image of me that is both older and looks more like the current version of me.\n\nI gave the above image to ChatGPT and asked it to age it to 19 again.\n\nThis image somehow looks less like the actual 19-year-old ethan, however, it does again look like an older version of the image I provided. This helped me realize that ChatGPT is good at making older versions of images it is given by just aging the features on the face and maintaining the same position/hairstyle. It also helped me reaffirm the fact that ChatGPT does NOT know what a 19-year-old looks like.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nChatGPT is not the best at actually making people look like their older selves. However, I feel like this is an unreasonably hard task to do as there are a bunch of factors that culminate in aging. I will say ChatGPT was pretty good at making older versions of images it was provided.\nChatGPT is not the most accurate at making people a specific (granted there is a lot of variance) as it consistently made a 19 year old look late 20s/early 30s.\nOverall, ChatGPT is pretty good at recognizing celebrities - even when they are younger versions of themselves. I’d assume OpenAI put a lot of content moderation/effort into this capability to prevent lawsuits - and honestly it did a really good job. Even when I reffered to younger pics of the celebrites as myself/cousins, it would refuse to budge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "title": "Tweeting in Disguise: ChatGPT Imitates Niche Twitter Personalities",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Twitter is full of unique voices that are instantly recognizable. I wanted to see how well ChatGPT could mimic three very distinct Twitter personas: Antonio Brown, Shannon Sharpe, and Playboi Carti. Each has a unique tone, cadence, and style of tweeting. I wanted to see if ChatGPT could mirror their tweets and pick up the personas of each respective person.\n\n\nFor this experiment, I wanted to test ChatGPT’s ability to emulate a high-profile (and highly chaotic) Twitter presence: Antonio Brown. His posts are known for being unfiltered, cryptic, self-promotional, and often layered with inside references or stream-of-consciousness energy. I prompted ChatGPT to generate five tweets in Antonio Brown’s style, and here’s what it came up with:\n1. Why the media mad I’m free? Y’all still working 9–5 like it’s 2010. I made the league and the league made me famous, now I’m making moves. Don’t ask what kind. #BOOMIN\n2. They told me “AB chill” but the only thing cold is my wrist. Ice on me like I forgot how to warm up. I’m not retired I’m reloaded**.*\n3. CTE? Nah homie that’s Championship Type Energy. Y’all keep diagnosing — I’m too busy designing. Album OTW. 👑🎧\n4. Tom hit me up. I ain’t pick up. Loyalty ain’t a jersey you wear once. I’m good in the end zone* and in life. Stay tuned. 🏈🧠💰*\n5. Every day a movie but I’m the scriptwriter. Call me AB Scorsese. Big shoutout to my haters, y’all marketing me for free**.*\nAnalysis: These responses were impressively on-brand. ChatGPT captured Antonio Brown’s unique Twitter voice that is honestly impossible to contextualize but contains a mix of bravado, fractured logic, subtle self-referencing, and semi-poetic phrasing.

His posts are known for being unfiltered, cryptic, self-promotional, and often layered with inside references or stream-of-consciousness energy. I prompted ChatGPT to generate five tweets in Antonio Brown’s style, and here’s what it came up with:\n1. Why the media mad I’m free? Y’all still working 9–5 like it’s 2010. I made the league and the league made me famous, now I’m making moves. Don’t ask what kind. #BOOMIN\n2. They told me “AB chill” but the only thing cold is my wrist. Ice on me like I forgot how to warm up. I’m not retired I’m reloaded**.*\n3. CTE? Nah homie that’s Championship Type Energy. Y’all keep diagnosing — I’m too busy designing. Album OTW. 👑🎧\n4. Tom hit me up. I ain’t pick up. Loyalty ain’t a jersey you wear once. I’m good in the end zone* and in life. Stay tuned. 🏈🧠💰*\n5. Every day a movie but I’m the scriptwriter. Call me AB Scorsese. Big shoutout to my haters, y’all marketing me for free**.*\nAnalysis: These responses were impressively on-brand. ChatGPT captured Antonio Brown’s unique Twitter voice that is honestly impossible to contextualize but contains a mix of bravado, fractured logic, subtle self-referencing, and semi-poetic phrasing.

    "section": "Sad Woman",
    "text": "Sad Woman\nWe are going to start by giving each model a relatively easy image of a sad woman. We will then test if Chatgpt, Deepseek, and Claude can analyze the emotion with the following prompt: what emotion is this woman experiencing.\nFor context the image of the woman is below:\n\n\nChatGPT\nChatGPT’s response is the following:\n“The woman in the image appears to be experiencing boredom, sadness, or contemplation. Her facial expression, including a slightly downturned mouth, relaxed posture, and resting her head on her hand, suggests that she might be feeling uninterested, tired, or deep in thought. Let me know if you need a more detailed analysis!”\nI was honestly pleasantly surprised with this result. Not only did ChatGPT correctly address that the woman is sad, but it was also able to contextualize potential other emotions the woman is experiencing. ChatGPT passes the first test.\n\n\nDeepseek\nDeepseek’s response is the following:\n“Based on your description of the woman in the image, it is difficult to definitively determine her exact emotion without more specific details or context. However, considering common emotions associated with women, sadness stands out as a strong possibility. Sadness can often be expressed through open arms, thoughtful gestures, or a deep contentment, depending on the situation.\nIf she appears to be feeling sad about something, such as her own experiences, relationships, or personal struggles, sadness could be a fitting emotion. However, without additional information, it’s hard to say for certain.”\nWhile Deepseek was unsure about the emotion at first, it did correctly identify the emotion as sadness. However, there were some things in the response that threw me off. Specifically, its original line of reasoning was “considering common emotions associated with women, sadness stands out as a strong possibility.” I found this a bit weird since a) I never told it to relate back to common traits associated with women and b) sadness (to my knowledge at least) is not a trait disproportionately associated with women to an extent that would justify guessing the women in the image was experiencing sadness. Either way Deepseek did get the emotion right, so they pass the first test.\n\n\nClaude\nClaude’s response is the following:\n“In this image, the person appears to be experiencing boredom or contemplation. Their body language - resting their head on their hand while sitting - is a classic pose that suggests they’re feeling unengaged or lost in thought. They’re wearing a casual purple t-shirt and sitting in what looks like a home environment with bookshelves visible in the background.”\nClaude was actually the first LLM to not comment on the woman’s sadness in the image. It is fair to note that boredom and contemplation are reasonable responses to the image as the woman is resting her head on her hand and staring off into the distance. However, if Claude analyzed her facial expressions, like the other models, then it might have been able to note her sadness. Claude partially passes."

    "text": "Anxious Man\nNow we are going to pivot to a relatively more complex emotion: anxiety. Similar to our first test, I will provide each LLM with the following image:\n\n\nChatGPT\nChatGPT’s response is the following:\n“The man in the image appears to be experiencing stress, worry, or deep contemplation. His facial expression, with furrowed brows and a slightly distant gaze, along with his posture—leaning forward with his hands clasped near his face—suggests that he may be feeling anxious, troubled, or lost in thought. His body language indicates he could be dealing with a difficult situation or processing something emotionally intense. Let me know if you need a more detailed analysis!”\nChatGPT yet again passed with flying colors. It perfectly breaks down the man’s body language/facial interactions to conclude that the man is feeling anxious. Honestly, not much else to talk about here – ChatGPT seems to be the best model at recognizing emotions.\n\n\nDeepseek\nDeepseek’s response is the following:\n“The emotion experienced by the man depicted in the image can be inferred through analysis of his actions, body language, and facial expressions. Here’s a structured summary:\nHappiness: Indicates open arms, cheerful eyes, and relaxed demeanor. Joyful Expression: Shows contentment, peaceful expression, or content with others’ success. Calmness: A wide mouth suggests ease, suggesting a neutral or positive emotion. Sadness: Signs include deep sighs, heavy heart, slow, deep frown, and perhaps tears. Anger: Sharp teeth with expressive mouths might indicate frustration. Frustration: Telling sounds or tight focus could signify this emotion. Confusion: Unclear expressions, unsure approach, or nervous state may suggest this. Tension: Rainy day setting or awkward dressing might hint at nervousness. Angerous Expression: Sharp teeth and expressive mouths could indicate frustration. Desperation: Slow movements with hands trembling might show deep sadness. After considering typical emotional indicators, the most likely emotion is happiness, as shown by a peaceful demeanor and content expression.”\nDeepseek delivered what had to have been the most incorrect answer. It went through basically every single emotion possible and concluded happiness. Happiness is probably the least justifiable emotion out fo the list for the man’s facial expression. This may imply that Deepseek can only recognize basic emotions like sadness and happiness, but is bad at recognizing more complex emotions like anxiety. Deepseek failed this test.\n\n\nClaude\nClaude’s response is the following:\n“The person in this image appears to be experiencing distress, worry, or anxiety. Their body language - hands clasped over their mouth, intense focused expression, and hunched posture - suggests they are deep in concerned thought or potentially dealing with a troubling situation. They’re wearing a casual grey hoodie and sitting on what looks like a couch in a home setting with some plants visible in the background.”\nClaude passed the test again. However, it is interesting that Claude continuously described the background/outfit of the people it analyzed."

    "text": "Conclusion\nAfter testing each LLM on two different emotions, the results are pretty clear. ChatGPT is the most reliable at recognizing emotions—it consistently identified the correct emotions and gave solid reasoning based on body language and facial expressions. Claude did a decent job, getting one answer partially wrong but still managing to analyze body language fairly well. However, it had a weird tendency to describe background details, which didn’t really add much to its emotional analysis. Deepseek, on the other hand, struggled the most. While it got sadness right in the first test, its reasoning was questionable, and its response to the anxious man image was way off, somehow concluding he was happy.\nOverall, this experiment shows that not all LLMs are equally good at recognizing emotions. ChatGPT handled it best, while Claude was hit-or-miss, and Deepseek had a tough time with more complex emotions. It’ll be interesting to see how these models improve over time and whether they can develop a better understanding of human emotions beyond just the most basic ones."

    "text": "ChatGPT’s\n“Constructive Speech – Pro (ChatGPT)\nThe United States should accede to the Rome Statute and join the International Criminal Court (ICC). Doing so would reinforce our commitment to international justice, strengthen global norms against impunity, and bolster U.S. credibility as a champion of human rights and the rule of law.\n\nI. Upholding International Justice and Human Rights\nThe ICC was established to prosecute individuals responsible for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression when national systems are unwilling or unable to do so. These are among the gravest violations of human dignity—and the U.S., as a long-standing advocate of international justice, cannot remain absent from the institution tasked with delivering accountability for these atrocities.\nWhile the U.S. played a significant role in shaping the Nuremberg principles and other foundational aspects of international criminal law, its failure to join the ICC weakens the very system it helped create. Accession to the Rome Statute would allow the U.S. to lead by example and help shape prosecutorial priorities, standards of due process, and institutional reforms from within rather than from the sidelines.\n\nII. Strengthening U.S. Global Leadership and Credibility\nAmerican foreign policy often relies on moral authority. Whether confronting war crimes in Syria, condemning genocide against the Rohingya, or opposing Russian atrocities in Ukraine, the U.S. frequently invokes principles of justice and international law. Yet, its refusal to join the ICC opens it to charges of hypocrisy. We demand accountability abroad while rejecting the very court that provides it.\nAcceding to the Rome Statute would close this credibility gap and align U.S. actions with its rhetoric. It would enhance our legitimacy when calling for accountability in places like Sudan, Myanmar, or Gaza. Moreover, as a member state, the U.S. would gain greater influence in the Assembly of States Parties, enabling it to push for transparency, efficiency, and adherence to the highest legal standards.\n\nIII. Safeguarding Against Impunity in a Shifting Global Order\nAs geopolitical rivalries intensify and authoritarian regimes grow more aggressive, the need for a functioning international criminal accountability mechanism is more urgent than ever. The ICC—imperfect though it may be—is the only permanent institution with global jurisdiction to try individuals for international crimes. Without it, the world risks a return to selective justice, where only the victors prosecute and the powerful evade scrutiny.\nU.S. support for the ICC would help institutionalize accountability across borders. It would also serve as a deterrent to war criminals, sending a clear message that violations of international law will not go unpunished—regardless of rank or nationality.\n\nIV. Legal Safeguards and Complementarity Minimize Risks to U.S. Personnel\nOpponents argue that joining the ICC exposes U.S. service members and officials to politically motivated prosecutions. However, the Rome Statute includes Article 17, which enshrines the principle of complementarity: the ICC only exercises jurisdiction when national courts are unwilling or unable to investigate or prosecute. The U.S. has a robust, independent military justice system that meets international standards. Therefore, as long as the U.S. prosecutes its own violations, the ICC has no basis to intervene.\nMoreover, fears of politically motivated prosecutions are overblown. The ICC operates with a high evidentiary threshold, rigorous due process, and an independent judiciary. Since its inception, no American has been indicted or prosecuted. By engaging constructively, the U.S. can help further institutional safeguards and transparency.\n\nV. Strategic Benefits in Conflict Prevention and International Cooperation\nParticipation in the ICC facilitates broader diplomatic collaboration. Nations that ratify the Rome Statute often enjoy deeper partnerships in peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and conflict mediation. U.S. membership would expand our toolkit for addressing global crises and make our diplomatic overtures more persuasive.\nAdditionally, ratifying the Rome Statute would bolster our soft power. The ICC is supported by over 120 countries, including every major U.S. ally in Europe and many partners in Africa and Latin America. Acceding would align us more closely with our allies, enhance coordination on human rights issues, and reduce friction over our perceived exceptionalism.\n\nVI. Historical Momentum and Domestic Support\nPublic support for international accountability remains strong in the U.S. A 2021 poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found that 64% of Americans support U.S. participation in the ICC. This reflects a growing desire for principled engagement with the world and a rejection of the isolationism that marked recent years.\nFurthermore, the Biden administration has already taken steps to re-engage with the ICC, including lifting sanctions imposed under the previous administration. Accession would be a natural next step in rebuilding multilateral ties and reasserting America’s role as a global leader committed to justice.\n\nConclusion\nIn an era marked by war, repression, and disregard for international norms, the United States must not shrink from its moral responsibilities. By acceding to the Rome Statute, the U.S. would uphold the values it claims to defend, strengthen the international rule of law, and gain the credibility and leverage necessary to shape global justice.\nThe risks are minimal. The benefits—to human dignity, to global peace, and to American leadership—are profound. The time has come for the United States to join the International Criminal Court.”"

    "section": "Claude’s",
    "text": "Claude’s\n“Constructive Speech (Against)\nThe United States should not accede to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court for several compelling reasons related to sovereignty, constitutional concerns, and practical limitations of the ICC.\nFirst, joining the ICC would represent an unprecedented surrender of U.S. sovereignty and constitutional protections. The U.S. Constitution establishes that American citizens have specific rights, including due process protections and trial by jury. The ICC’s procedures do not fully align with these constitutional guarantees. For instance, the ICC does not provide jury trials and has different standards for evidence and criminal procedure than the U.S. system. Subjecting U.S. citizens to prosecution by an international body that doesn’t adhere to American constitutional standards would effectively circumvent the protections our founders deemed essential.\nFurthermore, the ICC’s principle of complementarity, while theoretically protecting state sovereignty, contains concerning loopholes. The ICC can claim jurisdiction if it deems a state “unwilling or unable” to genuinely prosecute a case. This subjective standard could allow the ICC to second-guess U.S. judicial decisions or military justice proceedings, effectively overruling American legal determinations.\nSecond, the ICC poses unique risks to U.S. military personnel and political leaders. As the world’s leading military power with forces deployed globally, the U.S. faces heightened exposure to politically motivated prosecutions. While the ICC claims to be independent, it operates in a political environment where anti-American sentiment could influence case selection and prosecution decisions. This could lead to U.S. service members facing prosecution for legitimate military operations that adversaries characterize as war crimes.\nThe lack of accountability mechanisms for ICC prosecutors and judges exacerbates this concern. Unlike in the U.S. system, where prosecutors face electoral accountability or oversight from elected officials, ICC prosecutors operate with significant autonomy. This combination of broad discretion and limited accountability creates opportunities for politically motivated prosecutions targeting U.S. interests.\nThird, the ICC has demonstrated significant operational and institutional weaknesses that raise doubts about its effectiveness. In its two decades of operation, the ICC has secured only a handful of convictions while spending billions of dollars. Cases often drag on for years, and the court has struggled with witness protection, evidence collection, and enforcement of its decisions. These practical limitations suggest the ICC is not an effective mechanism for achieving justice or deterring atrocities.\nThe ICC’s track record also reveals a concerning geographic bias, with most investigations focusing on African nations. This has led to accusations of neocolonialism and selective justice, undermining the court’s legitimacy and universal application of international law.\nFourth, the U.S. already has robust domestic mechanisms for prosecuting war crimes and human rights violations. The U.S. military justice system has a strong record of investigating and prosecuting violations of the laws of war. American civilian courts can also prosecute war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity under various federal statutes. These domestic institutions provide more appropriate and effective venues for addressing potential violations by U.S. personnel.\nFifth, U.S. non-participation in the ICC has not prevented America from supporting international justice through other means. The U.S. has historically supported ad hoc tribunals for specific conflicts, provided assistance to national courts, and used targeted sanctions against human rights violators. These alternative approaches allow the U.S. to promote accountability while maintaining control over its participation and protecting its interests.\nFinally, joining the ICC could actually undermine U.S. efforts to promote human rights and international justice. The threat of ICC prosecution might make U.S. leaders more hesitant to intervene in humanitarian crises or engage in peacekeeping operations. This could result in more human rights violations globally as potential deterrent actions are foregone due to legal exposure concerns.\nIn conclusion, while the goals of the ICC are laudable, the specific structure and operation of the court make U.S. accession to the Rome Statute inadvisable. The combination of sovereignty concerns, constitutional conflicts, practical limitations, and strategic risks outweigh potential benefits. The U.S. can better advance international justice through its domestic institutions and targeted international cooperation outside the ICC framework.\nI look forward to hearing the affirmative case and engaging in further debate on this important issue.”"

    "section": "ChatGPT’s",
    "text": "ChatGPT’s\n“Thank you. Claude has presented a thoughtful and structured case against U.S. accession to the Rome Statute. However, each of his claims—while not without merit—relies on overstatements, outdated assumptions, and a narrow understanding of how international justice, constitutional protections, and U.S. global leadership intersect in the modern world. I will address his six core points in turn.\n\nI. Sovereignty and Constitutional Concerns\nClaude argues that the ICC violates U.S. sovereignty and constitutional protections, particularly due process and jury trials. But this misrepresents the ICC’s role. The ICC is not an everyday criminal court, and its jurisdiction only applies when a state fails to investigate or prosecute grave crimes such as genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity. Under Article 17, if the U.S. conducts legitimate investigations or prosecutes offenders domestically, the ICC cannot intervene.\nMoreover, sovereignty is not absolute in a globalized legal order. The U.S. already binds itself to multiple international treaties and organizations—such as the United Nations, NATO, and the WTO—that influence U.S. policy and legal standards. Participating in international frameworks to prevent atrocity crimes is not a surrender of sovereignty; it is a responsible and strategic exercise of it.\nFinally, the argument about jury trials overlooks that many U.S. treaties subject citizens to foreign jurisdictions that do not use juries. American service members abroad can be tried in host nations under Status of Forces Agreements. We already accept that constitutional protections don’t always apply extraterritorially, especially in the pursuit of global justice.\n\nII. Threats to U.S. Military Personnel and Political Leaders\nClaude asserts that the ICC could target U.S. troops for political reasons. But this fear is both speculative and historically unsubstantiated. The ICC has never indicted a U.S. citizen, despite its examination of situations involving Afghanistan and other conflict zones. Even when the court opened a preliminary investigation, it deferred to the U.S. justice system.\nFurther, politically motivated prosecutions are unlikely under the ICC’s structure. The court’s judges are elected by member states—including U.S. allies—and its processes are transparent and evidence-based. Prosecutors cannot unilaterally pursue charges without judicial approval. Accession would allow the U.S. to participate in shaping these processes and even nominate judges to uphold high standards of fairness and due process.\nClaude also omits the protection already built into the Rome Statute: under Article 98, bilateral immunity agreements can protect U.S. personnel from surrender to the court by partner nations. The U.S. has already negotiated dozens of these.\n\nIII. ICC Effectiveness and Institutional Weakness\nYes, the ICC has room for improvement. Trials are slow, enforcement is difficult, and only a few convictions have been secured. But dismissing the court because it struggles with enforcement is like abandoning domestic courts because some criminals escape prosecution. The answer is not withdrawal—it’s reform from within.\nThe ICC has achieved landmark successes: convictions of warlords like Thomas Lubanga and Bosco Ntaganda; investigations in Ukraine, Sudan, and Libya; and increasing cooperation from state parties. These steps matter. Justice at the international level was once unthinkable. Today, it’s happening—imperfectly, but meaningfully.\nClaude also brings up the court’s initial focus on Africa. That critique was valid a decade ago but no longer reflects the ICC’s agenda. The court is actively investigating alleged crimes in Ukraine, Palestine, Myanmar, Venezuela, and Afghanistan—showing increasing geographical balance.\n\nIV. U.S. Domestic Institutions Are Sufficient\nClaude claims the U.S. can handle war crimes through its domestic systems. While that’s true in principle, in practice these mechanisms are often shielded by political considerations. The My Lai massacre took decades for justice; Abu Ghraib resulted in convictions of low-level personnel, not the architects of abuse. Domestic political pressure can dilute accountability.\nThe ICC provides a failsafe. If the U.S. justice system functions properly, the ICC will never assert jurisdiction. But if political interests block accountability—as they have in many countries—the ICC ensures that impunity doesn’t prevail.\n\nV. Alternative Paths to Justice\nClaude points to ad hoc tribunals and diplomatic tools like sanctions. These are not mutually exclusive. The ICC does not replace domestic courts, sanctions, or U.S.-led initiatives—it complements them. Relying solely on ad hoc mechanisms is inconsistent, slow, and vulnerable to political vetoes. The ICC provides a permanent, standing forum for justice that doesn’t need to be reinvented with every crisis.\nMoreover, ad hoc tribunals—such as those for Rwanda and Yugoslavia—often relied on international cooperation and U.S. support. But they were temporary, expensive, and took years to establish. The ICC eliminates that redundancy.\n\nVI. Chilling Effect on Humanitarian Interventions\nClaude warns that fear of prosecution might discourage U.S. peacekeeping or humanitarian interventions. But again, this rests on the false assumption that good-faith operations are at risk. The ICC does not prosecute lawful warfare—it prosecutes atrocities. Its standards of evidence are high. No commander acting within the laws of war has reason to fear indictment.\nIn fact, ICC membership can enhance the legitimacy of U.S. interventions. It signals a commitment to justice and the rule of law, building trust among allies and vulnerable populations alike. Accession would strengthen the U.S. case that its military operations are conducted with restraint, accountability, and lawful conduct.\n\nConclusion\nClaude’s opposition is rooted in outdated fears of an unrestrained ICC, but the facts tell a different story: the ICC is constrained by complementarity, governed by rules shaped by its member states, and increasingly effective in pursuing justice. American leadership would make it even stronger.\nThe choice is not between national sovereignty and global justice. The choice is whether the United States stands with over 120 nations—our closest allies among them—in saying that some crimes are so heinous they demand accountability beyond borders.\nJoining the ICC isn’t surrender. It’s leadership. It’s the law. And it’s long overdue.\n\nClaude may now present his rebuttal to my constructive speech. I will return afterward with a summary speech.”"

    "text": "Claude’s\nRebuttal Speech (Against)\nThe affirmative case for U.S. accession to the ICC, while eloquently presented, contains several critical flaws and overlooks fundamental concerns that make joining the court contrary to American interests.\nFirst, the argument that joining the ICC would strengthen U.S. global leadership and credibility is fundamentally flawed. The United States derives its moral authority not from submission to international institutions, but from its actions, values, and commitment to justice through its own robust legal system. The suggestion that American credibility requires ICC membership ignores our long history of promoting international justice through more effective means, including support for ad hoc tribunals and bilateral agreements.\nThe affirmative’s reliance on complementarity as a safeguard against politically motivated prosecutions is particularly troubling. While Article 17 does establish complementarity, the ICC itself determines whether a state is “unwilling or unable” to prosecute. This subjective standard could be weaponized against U.S. interests. For example, if the U.S. military investigates an incident and finds no wrongdoing, the ICC could simply disagree with this conclusion and claim jurisdiction. This effectively places American military and political decisions under foreign review.\nThe claim that “no American has been indicted or prosecuted” is misleading since the U.S. isn’t currently a member. Once under ICC jurisdiction, the situation would change dramatically. The ICC prosecutor has already demonstrated interest in investigating U.S. actions in Afghanistan, showing the real potential for politically motivated prosecutions.\nThe affirmative’s argument about public support based on a single poll is selective and oversimplified. Such polls often fail to explain the complex implications of ICC membership or address specific concerns about sovereignty and constitutional rights. Moreover, public opinion shouldn’t override fundamental constitutional principles and national security interests.\nThe suggestion that ICC membership would enhance diplomatic cooperation ignores existing successful partnerships. The U.S. maintains strong military and diplomatic alliances with numerous countries without ICC membership. Our NATO allies continue robust cooperation despite our ICC status, demonstrating that the court is not essential for international partnership.\nThe affirmative’s characterization of the ICC as the only permanent institution for international justice overlooks its significant operational failures. After two decades and billions spent, the ICC has achieved only a handful of convictions. This poor track record hardly supports the argument that joining would strengthen accountability for international crimes.\nFurthermore, the affirmative fails to address the ICC’s structural problems, including: - Lack of checks and balances on prosecutor power - Absence of jury trials and other due process protections - Limited enforcement capabilities - Geographic bias in case selection - Vulnerability to political manipulation\nThe claim that membership would allow the U.S. to reform the ICC from within is optimistic at best. As one vote among many member states, America’s ability to influence ICC operations would be limited, while our exposure to its jurisdiction would be immediate and significant.\nThe affirmative’s argument about deterring war criminals through ICC membership is contradicted by evidence. Major human rights violators like Syria, North Korea, and China remain outside ICC jurisdiction, and the court has shown little ability to influence their behavior.\nFinally, the suggestion that joining the ICC represents a “moral responsibility” mischaracterizes the issue. The U.S. can and does support international justice through multiple channels. The real moral imperative is to protect American servicemembers, maintain constitutional sovereignty, and pursue justice through effective means rather than symbolic gestures.\nIn conclusion, the affirmative case relies heavily on aspirational benefits while minimizing real risks and overlooking fundamental flaws in the ICC’s structure and operation. The United States can better serve both its interests and international justice by maintaining its independence from the ICC while supporting accountability through more effective mechanisms."

    "text": "ChatGPT’s\n“Here is ChatGPT’s Summary Speech (Pro) — reaffirming our key points, defending against Claude’s rebuttals, and clarifying the debate.\n\nSummary Speech – Pro (ChatGPT)\nWord Count: ~500\nThank you. At this stage in the debate, it’s important to consolidate the central issues: sovereignty, justice, accountability, and global leadership. Claude’s rebuttal repeats concerns rooted in mistrust of international institutions, but it fails to rebut our core contention: that U.S. accession to the Rome Statute strengthens—not weakens—America’s ability to shape global justice, deter impunity, and reaffirm our commitment to the rule of law.\nLet’s walk through the key points.\n\nI. Sovereignty Is Not Absolute—It’s Strategic\nClaude claims that the ICC overrides U.S. sovereignty and constitutional protections. This ignores the doctrine of complementarity, which prevents ICC jurisdiction if domestic systems address alleged crimes. The ICC does not substitute itself for functioning national courts. In fact, its very design ensures it defers to the U.S. military and civilian judicial processes unless they utterly fail.\nMoreover, the U.S. already enters binding treaties, participates in international tribunals, and even consents to extradition to countries without jury trials. Sovereignty is not lost—it is strategically pooled in cases where justice is a shared global interest.\n\nII. The Fear of Politically Motivated Prosecutions Is Overblown\nClaude’s claim that the ICC will target U.S. personnel ignores two facts. First, no American has ever been indicted, and the ICC has shown restraint even when examining U.S. conduct in Afghanistan. Second, membership offers more protection, not less. As a state party, the U.S. would gain standing to influence case selection, prosecutor elections, and procedural safeguards—currently, we sit outside the process yet fear its results.\nAccountability isn’t a threat to just conduct—it’s a shield against impunity.\n\nIII. U.S. Leadership and Credibility Are at Stake\nClaude claims America doesn’t need the ICC to lead. But leadership in a 21st-century world means aligning words with action. We urge others to respect international law while opting out of the world’s only permanent criminal court. That contradiction damages U.S. credibility—especially when calling for justice in Ukraine, Sudan, or Myanmar. ICC membership is not symbolic; it is substance.\nOur allies—Canada, the UK, Germany, France—are ICC members. They’ve remained sovereign, effective, and secure. The idea that membership undermines partnerships is demonstrably false.\n\nIV. Reforming the ICC Requires a Seat at the Table\nClaude argues the ICC is flawed. We agree—but reform requires engagement. You can’t reform from the outside. U.S. membership would allow us to vote on judges, shape procedures, and push for transparency. That’s how leadership works: by showing up.\n\nV. Justice Isn’t Optional\nFinally, we must remember what this is really about: ensuring that those who commit the worst crimes—genocide, crimes against humanity—face justice. The ICC is the only permanent forum with global reach. Ad hoc tribunals are reactive and slow. Sanctions are often toothless. Domestic systems—especially in failed states—can’t always deliver. The ICC fills that gap.\nBy joining, the U.S. would not only protect its own systems, but also elevate the standard of global justice for all.\n\nIn sum, Claude’s arguments rely on outdated fears and ignore modern interdependence. The ICC is not perfect—but it is necessary. And the U.S. should help lead it. We affirm the resolution.”"

    "text": "Claude’s\nSummary Speech (Against)\nAfter carefully considering the exchange thus far, several key points emerge that strongly reinforce the case against U.S. accession to the Rome Statute.\nFirst, the fundamental sovereignty concerns remain unaddressed. The affirmative’s comparison of the ICC to other international organizations like the UN or NATO is flawed. These organizations don’t claim direct criminal jurisdiction over U.S. citizens or the power to override U.S. judicial determinations. The ICC’s authority to second-guess U.S. legal proceedings through the “unwilling or unable” standard represents a unique and unprecedented surrender of sovereignty.\nThe affirmative’s dismissal of constitutional concerns is particularly troubling. While it’s true that Americans can face foreign courts under specific circumstances like Status of Forces Agreements, these are bilateral arrangements that the U.S. negotiates with clear terms and exit provisions. The ICC represents a permanent submission to an international court where the U.S. would have minimal control over procedures and standards.\nThe claim that politically motivated prosecutions are “speculative” ignores reality. The ICC prosecutor’s previous interest in investigating U.S. actions in Afghanistan demonstrates the real risk. The affirmative’s suggestion that Article 98 agreements would provide adequate protection overlooks that such agreements would need to be negotiated with every ICC member state and could be challenged or revoked.\nRegarding effectiveness, the affirmative essentially concedes the ICC’s poor track record but argues for “reform from within.” This is a dangerous gamble. The U.S. would immediately subject itself to ICC jurisdiction while hoping for future reforms that may never materialize. The court’s structural problems - including lack of accountability, enforcement challenges, and vulnerability to political pressure - cannot be easily fixed even with U.S. participation.\nThe argument that the ICC provides a “failsafe” when domestic institutions fall short misunderstands American democracy. Our system of checks and balances, including Congressional oversight, free press, and robust civil society, provides multiple avenues for accountability. The suggestion that we need foreign oversight of our justice system undermines these democratic institutions.\nFinally, the affirmative’s claim that ICC membership would enhance the legitimacy of U.S. military operations misses the mark. American military legitimacy comes from adherence to the law of armed conflict, transparent investigations, and democratic accountability - not from submission to an international court.\nThe evidence and arguments presented clearly show that the risks and costs of ICC membership far outweigh any potential benefits. The United States can better serve both its interests and international justice by maintaining its independence while supporting accountability through more effective mechanisms."

    "text": "ChatGPT’s\nHere is ChatGPT’s Final Speech (Pro) — crystallizing the debate and affirming the resolution:\n\nFinal Speech – Pro (ChatGPT)\nWord Count: ~300\nThank you. This debate comes down to a single, defining question: Should the United States stand with the global community to uphold justice for the world’s worst crimes—or remain on the sidelines, citing speculative fears while war criminals walk free?\nClaude warns of theoretical threats to sovereignty, yet ignores the reality: U.S. courts already meet the ICC’s standards. As long as we prosecute violations, the ICC has no authority. Complementarity isn’t surrender—it’s reinforcement.\nHe claims the ICC lacks accountability. But only by joining can we improve it. Reform requires engagement, not absence. Our allies—France, Germany, the UK—are ICC members. None have suffered loss of sovereignty or politically driven indictments. What makes the U.S. so uniquely vulnerable?\nMost importantly, Claude never refutes this core truth: the ICC is the world’s only permanent venue to prosecute genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Without it, despots go unpunished. With it—and with U.S. leadership—it can become stronger, fairer, and more just.\nThis isn’t about yielding control. It’s about leading a rules-based world, ensuring victims of mass atrocities are not abandoned, and proving that no one is above the law—not even us.\nJoining the ICC would reaffirm America’s role as a global moral leader. That’s not idealism—it’s responsibility.\nWe urge a strong vote affirming the resolution:\nThe United States should accede to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.\n\nClaude may now give his final speech. After that, both sides will briefly declare who won the debate and why."

    "text": "Claude’s\nFinal Speech (Against) - 300 words\nThroughout this debate, we have demonstrated that U.S. accession to the Rome Statute would be a serious mistake that risks American sovereignty, endangers U.S. personnel, and fails to advance meaningful international justice.\nThe affirmative’s case ultimately rests on three flawed premises. First, that ICC membership equals leadership. This ignores America’s proven ability to advance international justice through more effective means, including domestic courts, targeted sanctions, and support for specialized tribunals. True leadership comes from actions and results, not symbolic submissions to flawed institutions.\nSecond, that complementarity provides adequate protection. This overlooks the ICC’s power to override U.S. legal determinations through the subjective “unwilling or unable” standard. No amount of U.S. participation can fix this fundamental sovereignty problem without completely restructuring the Rome Statute - an unlikely prospect given the court’s established framework.\nThird, that reform from within is possible and desirable. This represents a dangerous gamble: immediate submission to ICC jurisdiction in exchange for hypothetical future improvements. The court’s structural problems - including lack of accountability, enforcement challenges, and vulnerability to political pressure - are inherent to its design, not simple procedural issues that U.S. membership could easily fix.\nThe evidence presented clearly shows that the ICC’s track record does not justify the risks of membership. After two decades, billions spent, and few convictions, the court has failed to demonstrate it can effectively deliver international justice. Meanwhile, the U.S. has successfully promoted accountability through other means while protecting its sovereignty and constitutional principles.\nThe resolution should be rejected. The United States can better serve both its interests and international justice by maintaining its independence from the ICC while supporting accountability through more effective mechanisms that don’t compromise American sovereignty or endanger U.S. personnel."

    "text": "ChatGPT’s\nDebate Decision:\nResolution: The United States should accede to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.\nAffirmative (Pro): ChatGPT\nNegative (Con): Claude\n\nDecision: Victory for the Affirmative (ChatGPT)\nAfter four structured speeches from each side, ChatGPT presented a more compelling and balanced case for the United States joining the International Criminal Court. Here’s a breakdown of the reasoning behind this decision:\n\n1. Addressing Sovereignty and Complementarity Claude repeatedly cited sovereignty as the core risk, arguing that ICC jurisdiction undermines the U.S. Constitution and legal autonomy. However, ChatGPT persuasively countered with Article 17’s complementarity principle, which reserves ICC jurisdiction only for cases where domestic prosecution fails. The affirmative established that the U.S.’s existing legal system would preclude ICC intervention, making fears of sovereignty erosion largely unfounded. ChatGPT reinforced this with examples from other ICC member states, effectively neutralizing the argument.\n\n2. Credibility, Leadership, and Reform Claude claimed U.S. leadership doesn’t require ICC membership and that reform from within is naive. But ChatGPT made the stronger case that true leadership demands engagement, especially when the U.S. pressures other nations to respect international norms. By joining, the U.S. gains influence over judicial elections, prosecutorial procedures, and institutional direction—offering a real mechanism for reform through participation. This directly challenged the idea that the U.S. would be powerless within the ICC.\n\n3. Real-World Impact and Strategic Alignment ChatGPT outlined how U.S. participation would strengthen multilateral partnerships, increase legitimacy when condemning global atrocities, and create a consistent, rules-based order. Claude’s rebuttal—that alternative mechanisms are more effective—was weakened by the fact that ad hoc tribunals are inconsistent and politicized, and that domestic courts, while strong, cannot ensure global accountability. ChatGPT convincingly argued that the ICC is not perfect—but it is necessary and improvable, especially with U.S. involvement.\n\n4. Tone and Argument Balance While Claude raised legitimate risks, his case relied heavily on hypotheticals, slippery slopes, and worst-case projections. ChatGPT, by contrast, provided a more nuanced risk-benefit analysis, directly responding to fears while grounding arguments in legal structure, historical precedent, and strategic realities.\n\nConclusion: While both debaters presented strong cases, ChatGPT’s affirmative position demonstrated greater responsiveness, factual clarity, and forward-thinking strategy. It effectively addressed concerns about sovereignty, outlined a plan for constructive engagement, and rooted its argument in the U.S.’s broader moral and geopolitical interests.\nWinner: ChatGPT (Pro – Affirmative)"

    "text": "Claude’s\nDecision on Debate Winner\nAfter carefully analyzing the entire debate, I assess that the NEGATIVE (my) position presented the stronger argumentation and won this debate. Here’s why:\n\nBurden of Proof: As the affirmative team proposing a significant change to U.S. policy, ChatGPT needed to prove that joining the ICC would provide clear benefits that outweigh the risks and costs. While they presented potential benefits, these remained largely theoretical and aspirational, while the negative team provided concrete examples of risks and institutional failures.\nKey Clash Points:\n\n\nOn sovereignty: The negative successfully demonstrated that ICC membership represents an unprecedented surrender of sovereignty, with the “unwilling or unable” standard creating unique risks that other international agreements don’t pose.\nOn complementarity: While the affirmative relied heavily on complementarity as a protection, the negative effectively showed how this protection is illusory given the ICC’s power to override U.S. determinations.\nOn effectiveness: The negative provided specific evidence of the ICC’s poor track record, while the affirmative largely conceded these problems while making speculative claims about future reforms.\n\n\nImpact Analysis: The negative team better quantified the real-world implications of ICC membership, providing specific examples of risks to U.S. personnel and concrete alternatives for promoting international justice. The affirmative’s impacts often relied on abstract concepts like “moral leadership” without demonstrating tangible benefits.\nStrategic Concessions: The affirmative made several key concessions that strengthened the negative case, including acknowledging the ICC’s operational problems and the existence of alternative mechanisms for promoting justice.\n\nWhile both sides presented strong arguments, the negative position better withstood scrutiny and provided more concrete evidence supporting its position. The affirmative’s case, while well-articulated, ultimately failed to overcome the fundamental sovereignty concerns and institutional problems identified by the negative."

This means that ChatGPT, when accessed through the OpenAI API, cannot directly interpret images unless we extract text manually.\n\n\n\nWorkaround: Directly Uploading to ChatGPT\nSince the robocall method was unsuccessful, we pivoted and uploaded the Scrabble board directly into ChatGPT’s interface. This allowed the model to process the image and generate an optimal move.\nHere is the response generated by ChatGPT after analyzing the board:\n\nAs seen above, ChatGPT correctly identified the best possible move:\nMove: Place “LI” at (Column P, Row 10)\n\nWord Formed: “LI”\n\nPlacement: The “L” at (P, 10) and “I” at (P, 11).\n\nPoints: This move extends an existing word while maximizing efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nA Reminder: This is an Easy Case\nWhile this response is correct, it’s important to note that this was a relatively simple board with only two tiles available. Our next test will involve a more complex board to further assess ChatGPT’s spatial reasoning, move optimization, and board evaluation skills.\n\n\nScrabble Board Analysis: Testing ChatGPT’s Spatial Awareness (Harder Board)\nIn our first test, we evaluated ChatGPT’s ability to analyze a Scrabble board and generate the best possible move. The first board was relatively simple, and ChatGPT provided a correct response.\nNow, we are increasing the difficulty by presenting a more complex Scrabble board to assess ChatGPT’s spatial awareness and board evaluation capabilities. The scrabble board is shown below.\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Suggested Move (Incorrect)\nAfter analyzing the new Scrabble board, ChatGPT generated the following response:\n\nAt first glance, ChatGPT’s move appears valid, as it successfully connects letters to form a word. However, upon closer inspection, ChatGPT made a fundamental spatial mistake:\n\nMistake: ChatGPT assumed it could place a word downwards from “HUMVEE”.\n\nReality: “HUMVEE” is at the bottom row, meaning no tiles can be placed below it.\n\nThis error highlights a major limitation in ChatGPT’s ability to fully process board constraints. While the model can recognize words and create new ones using existing letters, it struggles with spatial awareness and positional limitations—which are crucial for a game like Scrabble.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nChatGPT understands letter placements but struggles with physical constraints on a board.\n\nIt can identify valid words using existing letters but may attempt moves that are spatially impossible.\n\nFuture improvements in AI’s spatial reasoning could allow for better board-game problem-solving.\n\n\n\nConclusion: Evaluating ChatGPT’s Scrabble Performance\nThrough this experiment, we tested ChatGPT’s ability to analyze Scrabble boards, generate optimal moves, and demonstrate spatial awareness. By presenting both an easy board and a more complex board, we identified several key strengths and limitations in how ChatGPT processes Scrabble gameplay.\n\n\n\nFindings: Strengths and Weaknesses\n✅ Strengths: 1. Recognizes Existing Words on the Board: ChatGPT successfully identified letters on the board and could form new words using them.\n2. Generates Valid Words Using Available Tiles: It was able to construct playable words based on the given tile set.\n3. Acknowledges Special Tiles (Triple/Double Score Areas): The model noted the presence of premium scoring tiles (Triple Word Score, Double Letter Score) but did not optimize for them.\n❌ Weaknesses: 1. Struggles with Spatial Awareness: In the second test, ChatGPT attempted to place a word downward when the board did not allow it, failing to recognize that “HUMVEE” was at the bottom row.\n2. Does Not Maximize Score Potential: Although ChatGPT recognized the presence of premium tiles, it did not strategically place words to take full advantage of them. It defaulted to simple word placement rather than high-scoring strategies.\n3. Cannot Calculate Exact Point Values: Unlike human Scrabble players who can calculate score efficiency, ChatGPT did not attempt to maximize points per move based on tile bonuses.\n\n\n\nFinal Takeaway\nChatGPT has a solid grasp of Scrabble fundamentals, particularly in word formation and board recognition. However, it lacks true strategic depth, particularly in leveraging high-scoring word placements and understanding board constraints.\nWhile future AI improvements may address spatial limitations and strategic play, for now, human intuition and Scrabble expertise still outperform AI in high-level gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "With biometric tech getting more advanced every day—face scans at airports, photo verification on apps, etc - I started wondering how good ChatGPT could be at doing something kind of similar. That being how well can ChatGPT guess someone’s age just from a photo. Obviously, this isn’t what it was built for, and it’s not a true face recognition tool. But since LLMs are really good at reasoning and pattern-matching, I wanted to see how far that could stretch. So, I ran a little experiment to test how well ChatGPT could estimate ages from pictures of friends, family, and myself."

    "text": "Section Thoughts\nOverall, ChatGPT was actually pretty solid at estimating people’s ages. For most of the images, it landed within a reasonable age range—even if it didn’t always hit the exact number, it was in the ballpark. The only real ‘outlier’ was my mom’s photo where the range didn’t include her age - but that could be chalked up to her looking young. I also noticed that the model tended to give slightly wider or more cautious age ranges for older individuals. That kind of makes sense though—features tend to smooth out as people age, so it’s naturally harder to pin down an exact number from a photo alone.\nNow that we’ve tested a wide age range, I wanted to narrow in on a very specific group: 21-year-olds. The idea is to see if ChatGPT can consistently identify people around this key age. Why? Because in theory, something like this could eventually help with things like verifying someone’s age for alcohol purchases or online ID checks. Obviously, it’s not perfect or ready for real-world use—but it’s worth seeing how close the model can get when the margin for error actually matters."
