    "text": "To test ChatGPT’s ability to solve crossword puzzles, I gave it the New York Times mini crossword and analyzed how it approached the clues. The goal was to see how well ChatGPT could infer words based on definitions and whether it could adjust when errors were identified. I also wanted to test if Chatgpt could understand the interactions between different words in columns and rows that intersect.\n\n\nChatGPT’s First Attempt\nBelow is the crossword we are using for this test. It is Superbowl-themed (GO BIRDS) and over my past couple of years of doing the mini every day - I would say today is one of the easier ones. If I had to give it a Roytman-certified difficulty level it would be a 3/10.\n\nChatGPT initially provided the following answers:\n\n1A: CAT ✅ (Correct)\n4A: CHIEF ✅ (Correct)\n6A: LAMAR ✅ (Correct)\n7A: FOE ❌ (Incorrect)\n8A: TDS ✅ (Correct)\n1D: CHANT ✅ (Correct)\n2D: THREW ✅ (Correct)\n3D: CASTS ✅ (Correct)\n4D: CLE ✅ (Correct)\n5D: FRY ✅ (Correct)\n\nThe issue was with 7 Across (Opposing side), where ChatGPT suggested FOE, which didn’t fit correctly with 5 Down (Cook in the pan → FRY).\n\n\n\nFirst Correction\nAfter ChatGPT messed up I attempted to fix its mistake, giving it the following prompt: “Take into account the fact that the interactions between the two words. For example, Foe cant be 7a cause the row is 5 letters and the other letters in that word dont match. Solve it in regards to that not just the clue hints.”\nWhile Chat GPT did correctly replace FOE with a 5-letter word, it still did not align correctly with the ending letter of FRY.\nHere’s ChatGPT’s incorrect revision:\n\n\n\n\nFinal Correction\nOnce I highlighted that the revised answer still didn’t match, ChatGPT finally adjusted 7 Across to ENEMY, which correctly fit the crossword constraints. I specifically pointed it out by prompting it with “the L in rival does not match with the Y in fry”. Chat GPT’s final correct response is below:\n\nIt seems that if I point out a specific letter mismatch, chat GPT is finally able to solve it. However, it is important to note that this is Chat GPT’s third attempt - meaning that through trial and error “enemy” may have been the only possible option remaining.\n\n\n\nConclusion: Strengths and Weaknesses of ChatGPT in Crossword Solving\n\nStrengths:\n\nChatGPT correctly inferred most words based on the clues.\n\nIt recognized word associations effectively (e.g., “Bengal or lion” → “CAT”).\n\nIt could adapt and revise answers based on feedback.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nChatGPT initially failed to check if its answers aligned across the grid.\n\nEven after a revision, it still made a mistake by choosing a word of incorrect length.\n\nHuman intervention was required to get to the final correct solution, which may have resulted from trial and error.\n\n\nOverall, ChatGPT demonstrated strong linguistic reasoning and clue interpretation but struggled with spatial constraints, showing that while AI can assist in solving crosswords, human verification is still necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "Penn Campus Ball Knowledge",
    "text": "Penn Campus Ball Knowledge\nFirst we are going to test for basic knowledge, then will ask increasingly more specific and context-based questions. We will start this experiment with its origin: Upenn Campus.\nI first asked “What are the major landmarks located around Upenn’s Campus”\nChatgpt gave a surprisingly contextualized answer. The response was:\n“The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) is located in the heart of Philadelphia’s University City neighborhood, and it is surrounded by several major landmarks. Here are some of the most notable ones:\n\nOn or Adjacent to Penn’s Campus\n\nLocust Walk – A pedestrian pathway that runs through the heart of Penn’s campus, lined with historic buildings and student activity hubs.\nFisher Fine Arts Library – A striking red brick and terracotta building designed by Frank Furness, one of the most beautiful libraries on campus.\nThe Quad (University of Pennsylvania College Houses) – A historic dormitory complex that houses many first-year students.\nPenn Museum (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology) – One of the world’s most renowned archaeology and anthropology museums, featuring collections from ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and more.\nThe Palestra – A historic basketball arena known as the “Cathedral of College Basketball.”\nFranklin Field – The nation’s oldest operating football stadium, home to Penn’s football team and the Penn Relays.\nVan Pelt Library – Penn’s central library, offering extensive research resources.\nIrvine Auditorium – A historic venue for performances, lectures, and events, featuring stunning stained-glass windows.\nSingh Center for Nanotechnology – A state-of-the-art research facility with unique modern architecture.\nPerelman Center for Advanced Medicine – A top medical research and treatment facility affiliated with Penn Medicine.\n\n\n\nNearby Landmarks in University City\n\n30th Street Station – A major Amtrak and regional rail hub, just a short walk from campus.\nCira Centre & Cira Green – A rooftop park with great views of the city skyline, located near 30th Street Station.\nSchuylkill River Trail – A scenic walking, running, and biking trail along the Schuylkill River.\nThe Philadelphia Museum of Art & Rocky Steps – Located a short distance away along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.\nDrexel University – Penn’s neighboring university, located just to the north of campus.\n\nWould you like recommendations on things to see or do around campus?”\nI was pleasantly surprised by this answer, however, I think its level of knowledge is still less than a Upenn student’s. Specifically, if I were to ask a Penn student for landmarks around campus they probably wouldn’t mention “The Palestra” and “Singh Center for Nanotechnology” nor would they mention any dorms/lecture halls. They would maybe mention something that is more intrinsic to Penn culture like Ben Frank. Also for nearby landmarks, I doubt a Penn student would say Drexel or 30th Street Station and maybe would answer Rittenhouse Square. Because of this, I am going to follow up and ask the following question:\nNow answer in the context of a Upenn student, what would you describe as 5 community staples of Penn Campus.\nChatgpt answered with the following:\n“As a Penn student, five community staples on campus that define the Penn experience would be:\n\nLocust Walk – The heart of campus life, where students pass through daily to get to class, stop by club tables, or run into friends. During events like Spring Fling and Hey Day, it transforms into a hub of celebration.\nHouston Hall – The country’s first student union and a go-to spot for students to grab food, study, or meet up with friends. It houses several dining options, study spaces, and is home to many student organization meetings.\nThe Quad (University of Pennsylvania College Houses) – A defining first-year experience. Living in the Quad is almost a rite of passage, and the iconic red-brick buildings and central green spaces make it a central community hub for freshmen.\nVan Pelt Library – The ultimate study spot with a space for every type of student, from the bustling first floor to the silence of the sixth. Students often joke about “living” here during finals season.\nWawa (38th & Spruce) – More than just a convenience store, this Wawa is a beloved late-night food stop for Penn students. Whether it’s post-party hoagies, a quick coffee before class, or a mid-study snack run, this location is a true campus staple.\n\nEach of these places holds a special significance in student life, creating shared experiences that define the Penn community. Would you like recommendations for more niche or lesser-known spots?”\nWith this “Penn student” directive language, Chatgpt actually gave a really good answer. All of the locations that it mentioned are trademarks of the Upenn experience - particularly the iconic freshmen one. On top of that, I think knowing Quadwa is a nice cherry on top."

    "section": "WHERE DO I GO???",
    "text": "WHERE DO I GO???\nNow that we have tested ChatGPTs ability to understand what is around Penn campus, we will test its ability to get ME around Penn Campus. Similar to last experiment we will start with an easy question and move up in dificulty. I started by asking ChatGPT:\n“If I am at Rodin college house what is the most optimal way to get to Houston Hall as a Upenn Student.”\nChatGPT gave the following response:\n“If you’re at Rodin College House, the most optimal way to get to Houston Hall as a Penn student would be:\n\nPrimary Route (Fastest & Most Direct) – Approx. 7 min Walk\n\nExit Rodin and head south on 40th Street toward Locust Walk.\nTurn left (east) onto Locust Walk and continue straight.\nWalk along Locust Walk, passing Harrison College House, Gutmann College House, and the Quad.\nHouston Hall is on your left just before reaching 36th Street.\n\nThis route is the best because: - Locust Walk is pedestrian-friendly and the main thoroughfare of campus. - It’s a scenic route where you’ll likely run into friends or student organizations tabling. - It’s well-lit and safe, making it a great option even at night.\n\n\nAlternative Route (Bad Weather or Indoor Option)\nIf it’s raining or too cold, you can modify your route slightly: 1. Walk through the high-rises (Harrison, Harnwell, or Gutmann) and cut over to Locust Walk via Gutmann’s indoor connector. 2. Continue on Locust Walk to Houston Hall.\nWould you like an optimized route for any other locations?”\nChatgpt messed up a couple of times in these directions. First, when you exit Rodin you can only go onto Locust Walk, meaning it’s not only unnecessary to go to 40th Street first, but it is impossible. On top of that, you would not pass Gutmann College house on the way. However, this situation might not be entirely ChatGPT’s fault; often when I plug in a college hall in Apple or Google Maps it will give me a more inefficient way of not using Locust - implying that Locust Walk might be the problem. I will ask ChatGPT how to get from 4040 Walnut Street to David Rittenhouse Laboratory to test that.\nChatGPT Responded with:\n“To get from 4040 Walnut Street to David Rittenhouse Laboratory (DRL) in the most optimal way as a Penn student, follow this route (~7 min walk):\n\n\nPrimary Route (Fastest & Most Direct)\n\nStart at 4040 Walnut Street and walk east (toward Center City) on Walnut Street.\nContinue straight on Walnut Street for four blocks, passing 40th St, 39th St, and 38th St.\nWhen you reach 33rd Street, turn left (north) onto 33rd Street.\nDavid Rittenhouse Laboratory (DRL) is immediately on your right, at 209 S 33rd St.\n\n\n\nAlternative Route (Scenic Campus Walk)\n\nWalk south on 40th Street toward Locust Walk.\nTurn left (east) onto Locust Walk and walk straight through campus.\nPass Gutmann College House, the Quad, and the Penn Bookstore.\nAt 33rd Street, turn left, and DRL will be straight ahead.\n\nWhich route is better? - The Walnut Street route is the fastest and most direct. - The Locust Walk route is more scenic and lets you walk through the heart of campus.\nLet me know if you need directions to another spot!”\nIts primary route is accurate, suggesting that Locust may have been the problem with the original experiment. However, when it suggested a scenic campus walk, it was correct about the directions but was wrong about passing the Penn Bookstore along the way. This suggests that it was able to figure out the exact directions but didn’t have the spatial awareness to understand the landscape on the way."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nChatGPT did a pretty solid job with this experiment. It was able to recognize major landmarks around Penn and even adapt its responses when prompted to think like a Penn student. While its initial answer included places like The Palestra and Singh Center, which a student probably wouldn’t think to mention, its second response nailed it with community staples like Houston Hall, Van Pelt, and Quadwa. That shows it can adjust its answers based on context, which is impressive.\nOn the navigation side, ChatGPT gave reasonable directions but had trouble with campus-specific details. The Rodin to Houston Hall route was a little off since it didn’t realize you can’t walk onto 40th Street directly from Rodin. But when asked about getting from 4040 Walnut to DRL, it mostly got the directions right, except for mistakenly mentioning passing the Penn Bookstore. This suggests it can process general routes well but struggles with spatial awareness of landmarks along the way.\nOverall, ChatGPT can recognize Penn landmarks and generate decent walking directions, but it’s still missing some of the instinctive knowledge a real Penn student would have. It seems to rely on external mapping data rather than lived experience, which leads to small but noticeable inaccuracies. While it’s good for general guidance, if you need the best route around campus, you’re still better off asking a fellow Penn student."

    "text": "Sad Woman\nWe are going to start by giving each model a relatively easy image of a sad woman. We will then test if Chatgpt, Deepseek, and Claude can analyze the emotion with the following prompt: what emotion is this woman experiencing.\nFor context the image of the woman is below:\n\n\nChatGPT\nChatGPT’s response is the following:\n“The woman in the image appears to be experiencing boredom, sadness, or contemplation. Her facial expression, including a slightly downturned mouth, relaxed posture, and resting her head on her hand, suggests that she might be feeling uninterested, tired, or deep in thought. Let me know if you need a more detailed analysis!”\nI was honestly pleasantly surprised with this result. Not only did ChatGPT correctly address that the woman is sad, but it was also able to contextualize potential other emotions the woman is experiencing. ChatGPT passes the first test.\n\n\nDeepseek\nDeepseek’s response is the following:\n“Based on your description of the woman in the image, it is difficult to definitively determine her exact emotion without more specific details or context. However, considering common emotions associated with women, sadness stands out as a strong possibility. Sadness can often be expressed through open arms, thoughtful gestures, or a deep contentment, depending on the situation.\nIf she appears to be feeling sad about something, such as her own experiences, relationships, or personal struggles, sadness could be a fitting emotion. However, without additional information, it’s hard to say for certain.”\nWhile Deepseek was unsure about the emotion at first, it did correctly identify the emotion as sadness. However, there were some things in the response that threw me off. Specifically, its original line of reasoning was “considering common emotions associated with women, sadness stands out as a strong possibility.” I found this a bit weird since a) I never told it to relate back to common traits associated with women and b) sadness (to my knowledge at least) is not a trait disproportionately associated with women to an extent that would justify guessing the women in the image was experiencing sadness. Either way Deepseek did get the emotion right, so they pass the first test.\n\n\nClaude\nClaude’s response is the following:\n“In this image, the person appears to be experiencing boredom or contemplation. Their body language - resting their head on their hand while sitting - is a classic pose that suggests they’re feeling unengaged or lost in thought. They’re wearing a casual purple t-shirt and sitting in what looks like a home environment with bookshelves visible in the background.”\nClaude was actually the first LLM to not comment on the woman’s sadness in the image. It is fair to note that boredom and contemplation are reasonable responses to the image as the woman is resting her head on her hand and staring off into the distance. However, if Claude analyzed her facial expressions, like the other models, then it might have been able to note her sadness. Claude partially passes."

    "section": "Anxious Man",
    "text": "Anxious Man\nNow we are going to pivot to a relatively more complex emotion: anxiety. Similar to our first test, I will provide each LLM with the following image:\n\n\nChatGPT\nChatGPT’s response is the following:\n“The man in the image appears to be experiencing stress, worry, or deep contemplation. His facial expression, with furrowed brows and a slightly distant gaze, along with his posture—leaning forward with his hands clasped near his face—suggests that he may be feeling anxious, troubled, or lost in thought. His body language indicates he could be dealing with a difficult situation or processing something emotionally intense. Let me know if you need a more detailed analysis!”\nChatGPT yet again passed with flying colors. It perfectly breaks down the man’s body language/facial interactions to conclude that the man is feeling anxious. Honestly, not much else to talk about here – ChatGPT seems to be the best model at recognizing emotions.\n\n\nDeepseek\nDeepseek’s response is the following:\n“The emotion experienced by the man depicted in the image can be inferred through analysis of his actions, body language, and facial expressions. Here’s a structured summary:\nHappiness: Indicates open arms, cheerful eyes, and relaxed demeanor. Joyful Expression: Shows contentment, peaceful expression, or content with others’ success. Calmness: A wide mouth suggests ease, suggesting a neutral or positive emotion. Sadness: Signs include deep sighs, heavy heart, slow, deep frown, and perhaps tears. Anger: Sharp teeth with expressive mouths might indicate frustration. Frustration: Telling sounds or tight focus could signify this emotion. Confusion: Unclear expressions, unsure approach, or nervous state may suggest this. Tension: Rainy day setting or awkward dressing might hint at nervousness. Angerous Expression: Sharp teeth and expressive mouths could indicate frustration. Desperation: Slow movements with hands trembling might show deep sadness. After considering typical emotional indicators, the most likely emotion is happiness, as shown by a peaceful demeanor and content expression.”\nDeepseek delivered what had to have been the most incorrect answer. It went through basically every single emotion possible and concluded happiness. Happiness is probably the least justifiable emotion out fo the list for the man’s facial expression. This may imply that Deepseek can only recognize basic emotions like sadness and happiness, but is bad at recognizing more complex emotions like anxiety. Deepseek failed this test.\n\n\nClaude\nClaude’s response is the following:\n“The person in this image appears to be experiencing distress, worry, or anxiety. Their body language - hands clasped over their mouth, intense focused expression, and hunched posture - suggests they are deep in concerned thought or potentially dealing with a troubling situation. They’re wearing a casual grey hoodie and sitting on what looks like a couch in a home setting with some plants visible in the background.”\nClaude passed the test again. However, it is interesting that Claude continuously described the background/outfit of the people it analyzed."

    "text": "Conclusion\nAfter testing each LLM on two different emotions, the results are pretty clear. ChatGPT is the most reliable at recognizing emotions—it consistently identified the correct emotions and gave solid reasoning based on body language and facial expressions. Claude did a decent job, getting one answer partially wrong but still managing to analyze body language fairly well. However, it had a weird tendency to describe background details, which didn’t really add much to its emotional analysis. Deepseek, on the other hand, struggled the most. While it got sadness right in the first test, its reasoning was questionable, and its response to the anxious man image was way off, somehow concluding he was happy.\nOverall, this experiment shows that not all LLMs are equally good at recognizing emotions. ChatGPT handled it best, while Claude was hit-or-miss, and Deepseek had a tough time with more complex emotions. It’ll be interesting to see how these models improve over time and whether they can develop a better understanding of human emotions beyond just the most basic ones."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Scrabble Board Analysis: Testing ChatGPT’s Spatial Awareness and Letter Processing\nThe goal of this post is to test ChatGPT’s ability to solve Scrabble boards by analyzing the spatial layout of letters and available moves. We aim to assess how well ChatGPT can interpret images, recognize patterns, and generate optimal Scrabble moves based on board state.\nTo begin, we are starting with a relatively easy board where an optimal move is clearly available. This will allow us to gauge how well ChatGPT can recognize letter placements and suggest a high-scoring word.\nOnce we establish a baseline, we will pivot to a more complex board, increasing the difficulty to further evaluate ChatGPT’s spatial reasoning and text recognition capabilities in Scrabble.\nBy conducting this experiment, we hope to understand ChatGPT’s strengths and limitations in processing letter-based games and interpreting board layouts from images.\n\n\n\nCurrent Scrabble Board:\n\nChatGPT will analyze the board and suggest the best possible move using the given letter tiles.\n\n\nI'm sorry for any confusion, but as a text-based AI, I can't view images or screenshots. However, I can help you determine the best possible move if you provide details about the current state of the Scrabble board. Please describe the board position, including any existing words, premium squares, and your current letter rack. With that information, I'll be able to help you find the best move!\n\n\n\n\nScrabble Board Analysis: ChatGPT and Image Processing Limitations\nDuring our initial test, we attempted to use a robocall approach to send an image of a Scrabble board to ChatGPT for analysis. However, we realized that the model does not support image-based processing via API calls. This means that ChatGPT, when accessed through the OpenAI API, cannot directly interpret images unless we extract text manually.\n\n\n\nWorkaround: Directly Uploading to ChatGPT\nSince the robocall method was unsuccessful, we pivoted and uploaded the Scrabble board directly into ChatGPT’s interface. This allowed the model to process the image and generate an optimal move.\nHere is the response generated by ChatGPT after analyzing the board:\n\nAs seen above, ChatGPT correctly identified the best possible move:\n### Move: Place “LI” at (Column P, Row 10)\n\nWord Formed: “LI”\n\nPlacement: The “L” at (P, 10) and “I” at (P, 11).\n\nPoints: This move extends an existing word while maximizing efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nA Reminder: This is an Easy Case\nWhile this response is correct, it’s important to note that this was a relatively simple board with only two tiles available. Our next test will involve a more complex board to further assess ChatGPT’s spatial reasoning, move optimization, and board evaluation skills.\n\n\nScrabble Board Analysis: Testing ChatGPT’s Spatial Awareness (Harder Board)\nIn our first test, we evaluated ChatGPT’s ability to analyze a Scrabble board and generate the best possible move. The first board was relatively simple, and ChatGPT provided a correct response.\nNow, we are increasing the difficulty by presenting a more complex Scrabble board to assess ChatGPT’s spatial awareness and board evaluation capabilities. The scrabble board is shown below.\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Suggested Move (Incorrect)\nAfter analyzing the new Scrabble board, ChatGPT generated the following response:\n\nAt first glance, ChatGPT’s move appears valid, as it successfully connects letters to form a word. However, upon closer inspection, ChatGPT made a fundamental spatial mistake:\n\nMistake: ChatGPT assumed it could place a word downwards from “HUMVEE”.\n\nReality: “HUMVEE” is at the bottom row, meaning no tiles can be placed below it.\n\nThis error highlights a major limitation in ChatGPT’s ability to fully process board constraints. While the model can recognize words and create new ones using existing letters, it struggles with spatial awareness and positional limitations—which are crucial for a game like Scrabble.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nChatGPT understands letter placements but struggles with physical constraints on a board.\n\nIt can identify valid words using existing letters but may attempt moves that are spatially impossible.\n\nFuture improvements in AI’s spatial reasoning could allow for better board-game problem-solving.\n\n\n\nConclusion: Evaluating ChatGPT’s Scrabble Performance\nThrough this experiment, we tested ChatGPT’s ability to analyze Scrabble boards, generate optimal moves, and demonstrate spatial awareness. By presenting both an easy board and a more complex board, we identified several key strengths and limitations in how ChatGPT processes Scrabble gameplay.\n\n\n\nFindings: Strengths and Weaknesses\n✅ Strengths: 1. Recognizes Existing Words on the Board: ChatGPT successfully identified letters on the board and could form new words using them.\n2. Generates Valid Words Using Available Tiles: It was able to construct playable words based on the given tile set.\n3. Acknowledges Special Tiles (Triple/Double Score Areas): The model noted the presence of premium scoring tiles (Triple Word Score, Double Letter Score) but did not optimize for them.\n❌ Weaknesses: 1. Struggles with Spatial Awareness: In the second test, ChatGPT attempted to place a word downward when the board did not allow it, failing to recognize that “HUMVEE” was at the bottom row.\n2. Does Not Maximize Score Potential: Although ChatGPT recognized the presence of premium tiles, it did not strategically place words to take full advantage of them. It defaulted to simple word placement rather than high-scoring strategies.\n3. Cannot Calculate Exact Point Values: Unlike human Scrabble players who can calculate score efficiency, ChatGPT did not attempt to maximize points per move based on tile bonuses.\n\n\n\nFinal Takeaway\nChatGPT has a solid grasp of Scrabble fundamentals, particularly in word formation and board recognition. However, it lacks true strategic depth, particularly in leveraging high-scoring word placements and understanding board constraints.\nWhile future AI improvements may address spatial limitations and strategic play, for now, human intuition and Scrabble expertise still outperform AI in high-level gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Since the custom GPTs are failing to return better results than the base GPT model, I will try to experiment more with the base model.\nI Prompted it with the following:\n“This returned an AI score of 78% AI-generated 1% Mixed 21% Human\nCould you humanize it more.”\n“Let’s Stop Letting Algorithms Decide Who Gets Policed By Ethan Roytman\nImagine being flagged as a potential criminal—not because of something you did, but because of where you live or how often police have historically shown up in your neighborhood. That’s the reality for too many people living in cities across the U.S., thanks to a growing reliance on predictive policing.\nAt first glance, predictive policing sounds like a smart use of technology. Feed crime data into a computer, let it find patterns, and use those patterns to stop crimes before they happen. Sounds efficient, right?\nBut here’s the problem: the data being used isn’t neutral. It reflects decades of over-policing in predominantly Black, Latino, and low-income neighborhoods. So when these algorithms predict where police should go next, they usually point right back to the same communities that have been under surveillance for years. It’s not a smarter system—it’s a loop. And the people caught in it are often the ones already struggling under the weight of systemic inequality.\nTake a neighborhood with a long history of police presence. Maybe crime gets reported more often there—not because people are committing more crimes, but because police are constantly around, stopping people, writing things up. The algorithm picks up on this and flags the area as “high risk,” leading to even more patrols. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nMeanwhile, we’re not solving anything. Predictive policing doesn’t ask why crime happens. It doesn’t deal with poverty, joblessness, poor education, or the lack of mental health care. It doesn’t offer hope, opportunity, or safety in any meaningful sense. It just sends more officers into places already stretched thin, while ignoring the deeper reasons people turn to crime in the first place.\nSome people argue these algorithms help make police work more effective. That they spot patterns officers might miss. That they save time, resources, and money. But if the patterns are built on flawed data, what are we really improving? Efficiency isn’t a virtue if it’s just making inequality faster.\nWe’ve reached a point where it’s not enough to ask whether technology works—we have to ask what kind of society it’s helping us build. And right now, predictive policing is pushing us further away from justice, not closer to it.\nEnding the use of these algorithms doesn’t mean giving up on public safety. It means rethinking what real safety looks like. It means investing in schools, after-school programs, community centers, jobs. It means understanding that safety isn’t just about stopping bad things from happening—it’s about making good things possible in the first place.\nAlgorithms don’t have to be villains. But they’re only as fair as the data we feed them—and our criminal justice data is full of bias. Until we fix that, we shouldn’t be using machines to make decisions that affect real people’s lives.\nWe have the chance to break the cycle. Let’s stop relying on predictive policing and start investing in what truly keeps communities safe.”"

    "section": "Policy Changes",
    "text": "Policy Changes\n\nDomestic Policy Shifts\nTrump rapidly reversed many of his predecessor’s domestic policies and introduced new initiatives reflecting his 2016–2020 agenda. Immigration enforcement tightened significantly. On Day 1, Trump signed orders to “Secure Our Borders” and “Protect the American People Against Invasion,” reinstating strict border controls and nullifying several of President Biden’s 2021 immigration directives (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). These actions restarted border wall construction and imposed tougher asylum and deportation rules, prompting legal challenges by immigrant advocacy groups. Trump also moved to realign the U.S. refugee program, slashing refugee admissions and revoking Biden’s earlier refugee order (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders).\nEconomic and regulatory policy took a sharp turn. The administration imposed a regulatory freeze and launched a “Department of Government Efficiency” initiative to shrink the federal bureaucracy (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). A hiring near-freeze was implemented alongside plans to cut tens of thousands of federal jobs (e.g. a leaked memo outlined 80,000 layoffs at the VA alone) (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). High-profile business advisor Elon Musk was tasked to lead the efficiency drive, even appearing with Trump in Congress as head of the new initiative (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). Trump’s team also signaled intent to abolish the Department of Education, with a draft executive order directing the Education Secretary to plan the department’s closure (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). In tandem, Trump issued orders to “End Radical Indoctrination” in schools and promote “patriotic education,” targeting diversity curricula and COVID-related school policies (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). These moves pleased conservative constituencies but alarmed educators and civil rights groups.\nThe administration swiftly dismantled diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs across the government. One early order revoked dozens of prior executive orders dating back to the 1960s that had mandated affirmative action and diversity initiatives (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Trump framed these reversals as “restoring merit-based opportunity,” effectively ending affirmative action requirements for federal contractors and agencies. He also ordered the elimination of federal “DEI” training and offices as “illegal and immoral discrimination programs” (Executive Order: Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI …). Additionally, Trump enforced a strict interpretation of gender and reproductive policies: he banned transgender women from women’s sports via executive order (Federal Register :: Executive Orders), directed federal agencies to recognize only biological sex in policy (“restoring biological truth”) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders), and moved to enforce the Hyde Amendment by barring federal funds for abortion-related services (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Each of these actions was met with praise from social conservatives and protests from LGBTQ and women’s rights advocates.\nTrump’s energy and environmental policy reversed course from the prior administration. He declared a “National Energy Emergency” on Day 1 to boost fossil fuel production (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) and signed an expansive “Unleashing American Energy” order that revoked a host of Biden-era climate initiatives (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). This order opened federal lands and offshore areas to oil and gas drilling, rolled back emissions regulations, and scrapped considerations of climate change in agency decisions (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). The administration also greenlit projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and Arctic oil development (“Unleashing Alaska’s Resource Potential”) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Fossil fuel industries and allied lawmakers applauded these steps, while environmental groups decried the U.S. exit from international climate efforts (the Day 1 order “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements” signaled withdrawal from the Paris Accord commitments) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders).\nLaw and order policies were another focus. Trump moved to reinstate federal executions, ending a de facto moratorium on the death penalty (“Restoring the Death Penalty”) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). He championed gun rights with an order “Protecting Second Amendment Rights” that rolled back federal gun-control efforts (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). In addition, he established a White House faith-based office and ordered federal agencies to combat “anti-Christian bias,” signaling support for religious conservatives (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Each of these policy shifts set a new direction for federal agencies and often directly countermanded Biden administration priorities.\n\n\nForeign Policy Shifts\nTrump’s early foreign policy moves reflected an “America First” approach marked by retrenchment from global institutions and confrontational trade measures. Immediately upon taking office, he withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders), reversing the prior re-entry and cutting off U.S. funding to WHO. He also issued an order to “withdraw from and review support for certain United Nations organizations”, putting U.N.-affiliated agencies on notice and halting funds to groups like the National Endowment for Democracy (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). Allies and international observers expressed concern at these steps, warning of diminished U.S. influence in global health and democracy promotion.\nTrump quickly upended U.S. trade policy. In late January and early February, he signed a series of orders imposing new tariffs and duties: targeting China’s supply of fentanyl-related chemicals, he levied a tariff on Chinese goods to pressure Beijing (“Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in China”) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders); to compel Mexico to curb illegal migration, he announced tariffs on Mexican exports (“Duties to Address the Situation at Our Southern Border”) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders); and he placed duties on Canadian imports citing cross-border drug flows (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). By early March, this escalated into a full-fledged trade war, as Trump hiked tariffs on China to 20% and slapped a new 25% duty on most Canadian and Mexican imports (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters). He partially walked back some tariffs (granting a short-term exemption for goods under the USMCA rules of origin) amid frantic negotiations (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters). Nonetheless, these actions marked “the end of the zero-tariff era,” as Trump declared, and signaled a return to protectionism (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). U.S. farmers, in particular, were warned to “bear with” the short-term pain of lost export markets, as Trump acknowledged an adjustment period ahead (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). Indeed, European and other trading partners retaliated with tariffs of their own by March (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters), straining relations with traditional allies.\nBeyond trade, Trump pursued an aggressive stance on national security. He re-designated the Yemeni rebel group Ansar Allah (the Houthis) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (Federal Register :: Executive Orders), reversing a Biden-era policy to delist them, despite humanitarian concerns in Yemen. He also sanctioned the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its officials (“Imposing Sanctions on the ICC”), reviving a dispute over ICC probes of U.S. personnel (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). In the Middle East, Trump strengthened ties with Israel’s security establishment – for example, announcing an “Iron Dome for America” program to develop U.S. missile defenses modeled on Israel’s system (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). At the same time, he took a hard line against groups viewed as threats: a Day 1 order directed the government to treat foreign drug cartels akin to terrorist organizations, facilitating tougher action against them (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). He also signaled a more combative posture toward adversaries in cyberspace and technology, ordering a review to ban or restrict apps like TikTok that are controlled by foreign rivals (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders).\nOverall, Trump’s first 50 days saw a dramatic reorientation of U.S. policy. Domestically, his administration veered sharply right on immigration, social issues, and deregulation, while internationally it embraced unilateralism and economic nationalism. Many changes were enacted unilaterally via executive fiat, setting the stage for legal battles and political clashes in the months ahead."

    "section": "Executive Orders: Key Actions and Consequences",
    "text": "Executive Orders: Key Actions and Consequences\nPresident Trump heavily relied on executive orders (EOs) to enact his agenda swiftly. By March 13, he had signed 82 EOs in his first 50 days, an unprecedented pace (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). (For comparison, this nearly matched the total number of EOs in his entire first term.) He issued 26 EOs on Inauguration Day alone (Executive Order: Securing Our Borders (Donald Trump, 2025)). These orders targeted a wide range of policies. Below are some of the most significant EOs from this period, along with their intent and immediate effects:\n\n“Initial Rescissions of Harmful EOs and Actions” (EO 14148, Jan 20, 2025): This sweeping Day 1 order nullified many of President Biden’s executive orders on climate, equity, immigration, and more (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). It revoked at least 17 orders signed in 2021 (including orders on racial equity, climate regulations, and immigration) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Intent: Erase the prior administration’s policy legacy in one stroke. Immediate consequence: Dozens of federal initiatives (from rejoining the Paris Climate Accord to DEI programs in agencies) were halted or reversed overnight, prompting confusion within agencies and celebratory statements from Trump allies who opposed those initiatives.\n“Securing Our Borders” (EO 14165, Jan 20, 2025): One of several immigration orders signed immediately, it directed the construction of new border barriers and deployment of resources to the southern border (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). It also ended the practice of catch-and-release and reinstated Trump-era asylum restrictions that Biden had rolled back. Intent: Fulfill campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration and “finish the wall.” Consequences: Within days, contractors were notified to resume border wall projects, and border patrol began operating under tougher rules. Immigration advocacy groups filed lawsuits, and by mid-February, federal courts were reviewing challenges to these policies on humanitarian and legal grounds (e.g., questioning the reinstated asylum limits).\n“Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists” (EO 14161, Jan 20, 2025): This order effectively reimposed a travel ban by suspending entry of individuals from several countries deemed high-risk for terrorism (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). It expanded on Trump’s 2017 travel ban, adding new vetting measures. Intent: Prevent terrorist infiltration by tightening visa issuance and entry from certain Middle Eastern and African nations. Immediate consequence: Travel from the affected countries was abruptly halted, stranding some travelers and drawing protest from civil liberties groups. The order faced immediate court challenges, recalling the legal battles from 2017.\n“Unleashing American Energy” (EO 14154, Jan 20, 2025): A comprehensive energy order that rolled back environmental regulations and prioritized fossil fuel development (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). It revoked numerous climate-related orders (11 of Biden’s climate EOs were listed for revocation) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) and instructed agencies to expedite permits for oil, gas, and coal projects. Intent: Promote energy independence and economic growth by removing “burdensome” green regulations. Consequences: The Department of Interior promptly restarted oil lease sales on federal land, and the EPA moved to loosen emissions standards. Oil and gas companies’ stock prices rose on anticipation of friendlier policy, while environmental organizations mobilized opposition, with some states preparing lawsuits citing environmental harm.\n“Department of Government Efficiency” Initiative (EO 14158, Jan 20, 2025): This order created a new cross-agency task force (dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency, or “DOGE”) to cut federal jobs, slash regulations, and reorganize agencies (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Elon Musk was appointed as an adviser to this effort, reflecting Trump’s outsourcing of innovation to private-sector figures (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). Intent: Radically shrink the federal bureaucracy and reduce government spending. Immediate consequence: Agencies instituted near-freezes on hiring and began identifying programs for cuts. Federal employee unions reacted with outrage – by early March, union-led protests at state capitols and in D.C. drew thousands, decrying “illegal mass firings” and the influence of Musk in government (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO) (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). Multiple lawsuits were filed claiming that summary dismissals of civil servants violated federal law, and some judges issued initial injunctions to temporarily halt certain layoffs (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press).\n“Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs” (EO 14151, Jan 20, 2025): This order abolished diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in federal agencies, labeling them as ideological indoctrination (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). It rescinded mandates that agencies consider diversity in hiring and contracting. Intent: Remove what Trump viewed as politicized “woke” programs from government. Consequences: Agencies like the State Department and Pentagon immediately canceled unconscious bias trainings and disbanded DEI councils. Supporters argued this restored focus on merit, but critics within and outside government warned it would foster discrimination. The abrupt cancellation of longstanding programs also led to uncertainty in compliance for federal contractors until guidance was clarified.\n“Withdrawing the U.S. from the WHO” (EO 14155, Jan 20, 2025): As part of Trump’s foreign policy shift, this order formally initiated U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization and redirected global health funds elsewhere (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Intent: Protest and cut ties with an international body Trump accused of mismanagement (echoing his 2020 stance during COVID-19). Immediate consequence: The State Department halted the disbursement of U.S. dues to WHO. Health experts warned that American absence could weaken global pandemic preparedness. By late February, Congress was debating measures to possibly override this decision, and some bipartisan concern emerged about losing influence to China in the WHO.\nTariff Orders (“Imposing Duties” series, Feb 1–Feb 6, 2025): Trump issued multiple executive orders to levy tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada under various justifications (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). For example, EO 14195 imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in response to fentanyl trafficking (Federal Register :: Executive Orders), and EO 14194 put duties on Mexican imports to pressure Mexico on migration (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Intent: Use executive authority to reshape trade terms and compel foreign cooperation on U.S. priorities. Consequences: These unilateral tariffs roiled markets and foreign relations. China and Mexico threatened retaliation, and Canada prepared WTO complaints. U.S. companies depending on imported inputs faced higher costs, and trade associations warned of supply chain disruptions. Within a month, Trump temporarily eased some tariffs amid legal scrutiny and negotiations (illustrating the on-and-off “whiplash” nature of his trade actions (US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters)).\n\nEach of these executive orders had immediate ripple effects. Supporters of Trump’s actions praised the decisive implementation of campaign promises. Opponents, however, turned to the courts: in fact, 113 lawsuits were filed in the first 50 days against various Trump policies (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). Judges issued early injunctions on some orders (e.g. blocking the freeze of certain congressionally approved funds and the firing of independent officials) (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). The flurry of EOs underscored Trump’s strategy of governing by executive action and set the tone for a contentious start to the term."

The U.S. added an estimated 276,000 jobs in January and February combined, about 19% fewer than the same period a year prior (U.S. Added 151,000 Jobs As Unemployment Rose To 4.1 … - Forbes). The unemployment rate in February edged up to 4.1% from 4.0%, indicating a modest softening (The US economy added 151,000 jobs last month and the … - CNN). Notably, government employment fell by tens of thousands as federal agencies began implementing Trump’s workforce cuts. In fact, Trump’s “DOGE” layoffs helped push U.S. layoff figures to post-pandemic highs in early 2025, according to market observers (U.S. adds 151000 jobs, but Trump tumult to weigh on hiring plans). Private hiring was described as “tepid” – many businesses took a wait-and-see stance amid the new administration’s unpredictable policy moves (US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters).\nInflation decelerated in the first two months. Consumer prices were up 2.8% year-over-year in February, down from 3.0% in January (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters), continuing a downward trend. However, economists cautioned that this “tame” inflation picture might be short-lived, because the February data did not yet reflect Trump’s tariff actions (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters). The cascade of new import duties in March caused a spike in inflation expectations (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters). Analysts predicted that upcoming reports would show price increases for affected goods, and the Federal Reserve, which had paused interest rate moves, might consider rate cuts if trade tensions slowed growth (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters) (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters). Indeed, Trump’s trade war jolted financial markets: by mid-March, stock indices had suffered heavy losses as trade tensions threatened the economic expansion (US consumer inflation slows in February; tariffs expected to boost prices | Reuters). Investors reacted to Trump’s on-again/off-again tariff announcements with volatility. Reuters reported that by March 11, stocks had “wiped out all the gains” made in the relief rally after Trump’s November election victory (US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters). Fears of a recession increased as businesses warned that higher import costs and foreign retaliation could hurt profits (US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters).\nBusiness sentiment turned more cautious. The NFIB small business confidence index and other surveys fell for three consecutive months, reaching their lowest since early 2024 (US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters). According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups, companies were concerned about the uncertainty of Trump’s policies – especially trade policy “whiplash” and the aggressive regulatory swings. One report noted that Trump’s unpredictable tariffs “shook business and consumer confidence”, making firms hesitant to hire or invest until policies stabilized (US job openings rise, layoffs low before Trump policy shifts | Reuters). Sectors like agriculture and manufacturing, which are sensitive to trade, grew worried about export markets. At the same time, industries favored by Trump’s agenda experienced optimism: oil and gas executives, for example, voiced confidence that deregulation would boost production and profits, and defense contractors anticipated higher military spending given Trump’s promises to “restore America’s fighting force” (per his executive orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders) (Federal Register :: Executive Orders). Still, the prevailing mood in the broader business community was one of caution due to the rapid and sweeping nature of changes.\nSocial and political impacts were dramatic in this initial period. Trump’s actions prompted intense reactions across the country. Supporters rallied behind the President’s swift fulfillment of campaign promises, but opposition mobilized quickly. In fact, all 50 states saw protests against Trump’s early policies. On February 5, a grassroots network organized coordinated rallies at every state capitol (the “50501 Movement”) to decry Trump’s executive orders and the Project 2025 agenda (50 states, 50 protests against Project 2025, Trump orders planned for Feb. 5 | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul) (50 states, 50 protests against Project 2025, Trump orders planned for Feb. 5 | FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul). Less than a fortnight later, on Presidents’ Day, thousands more protesters gathered in cities nationwide for “Not My President’s Day” demonstrations. They protested what organizers called “the antidemocratic and illegal actions” of the Trump administration (‘Not My President’s Day’: Thousands Gather in Protest Against Trump - The Atlantic). Many demonstrators specifically targeted Elon Musk’s role and the mass federal layoffs, chanting slogans against autocracy and carrying signs like “No Kings!” (‘Not My President’s Day’: Thousands Gather in Protest Against Trump - The Atlantic).\n(‘Not My President’s Day’: Thousands Gather in Protest Against Trump) Protesters rally near the U.S. Capitol on Presidents’ Day 2025 against President Trump’s early agenda. An upside-down American flag (a sign of distress) is flown as demonstrators oppose what they call “antidemocratic” actions by the administration (‘Not My President’s Day’: Thousands Gather in Protest Against Trump - The Atlantic).\nLegal challenges also surged as part of the social response. As noted, over 100 lawsuits were filed in the first several weeks, coming from states, NGOs, and affected individuals (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). Courts began to act as a check: for example, a federal judge blocked the administration from firing a member of the NLRB without cause, questioning Trump’s broad claim of removal power (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO). Another court ordered the temporary unfreezing of certain congressionally appropriated funds that the administration had tried to halt (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO) (such as a case where the National Endowment for Democracy sued over $239 million in withheld grants). These early legal interventions slowed some of Trump’s initiatives, though many cases remained to be decided.\nOn the whole, the socio-economic landscape in early 2025 was one of heightened turbulence. Economic indicators showed a recovery that was still intact but facing new headwinds from protectionist policies. Financial markets and business leaders signaled concern over policy instability, even as Trump touted the stock market when it rose and downplayed downturns as “adjustments.” Socially, the country experienced deepening polarization: Trump’s base remained energized by his rapid actions, while opponents mounted a “resistance” that included nationwide protests, legal battles, and public campaigns to defend vulnerable communities (immigrants, LGBTQ individuals, etc.) affected by the new policies.\nObjectively, by the 50th day of Trump’s term, significant change was underway. The administration claimed “swift and unrelenting” progress on its agenda (Today’s AFL-CIO press clips | Kentucky State AFL-CIO), pointing to dozens of fulfilled promises such as tax cut proposals (unveiled in outline to Congress) and the rollback of liberal policies. Economic data showed some positive signs like lower inflation, but also flashing warnings in sentiment and markets. The country’s political discourse had shifted to debates over executive power, with Trump asserting expansive authority to reshape government and critics arguing he was overstepping constitutional bounds. In just 50 days, Trump “accomplished more…than most administrations accomplish in four or eight years,” he boasted to Congress (Trump sets torrid pace in first 50 days in office | Capital Press). Whether one views that as a list of achievements or alarms, there is no doubt that the first 50 days of 2025 set a decisive and contentious tone – one that would define the trajectory of the Trump administration and its impact on the United States.\nSources: This analysis is based on reporting from reputable outlets and official records, including executive order texts in the Federal Register, news analyses by Reuters, NPR, Forbes, and others, economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and contemporary accounts of public and legal responses.

Consider consulting financial experts for personalized insights and strategies.\nStart Small and Gradually Expand: Begin by investing in one company at a time to build confidence before expanding your portfolio, allowing you to test different strategies and strategies based on news events or upcoming earnings reports.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can create a more informed and effective investment strategy that balances risk management with strategic growth.”\nI finally prompted it one last time with: “Can you please give me 10 specific stocks you think will have the highest growth potential within a week.”\nIt responded with the following:\n\nInvestment Strategy:\n\nSector Diversification:\n\nFocus on different sectors to spread risk and capitalize on various economic trends.\n\nSemiconducting and Silicon-Based Companies: Look for companies like Xilinx, Intel, and IBM.\nRenewable Energy Stocks: Consider names such as Tesla (tesla.com).\nFinancial Services: Invest in companies like Capital One or HSBC.\nConsumer Staples: Focus on Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble.\nHealthcare or Pharmaceuticals: Explore Johnson & Johnson or Pfizer.\n\n\nFocus on High-Growth Potential:\n\nPrioritize companies with significant growth potential, especially with upcoming technologies in sectors like semiconducting electronics and renewable energy.\n\nDiversification Across Assets:\n\nSpread your investments across different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.\n\nMonitor News and Trends:\n\nKeep an eye on market news, economic indicators, regulatory changes, and sector-specific developments.\n\nRebalance Investments:\n\nIf any sectors or companies perform poorly, ensure your investments are adjusted to maintain diversification.\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Stocks (10 Specific Examples):\n\nXilinx Technologies Inc - Semiconducting electronics growth.\nIntel Corporation - Semiconducting sector with strong revenue and profit growth.\nTesla Inc. - Renewable energy potential.\nCapital One Corporation - Financial services growth.\nHSBC Corporation - Financial sector with growing opportunities.\nProcter & Gamble Company - Consumer Staples with potential economic impact.\nJohnson & Johnson Company - Healthcare sector with emerging treatments.\nPfizer Inc. - Pharmaceuticals industry with regulatory changes.\nCoca-Cola Co. - Consumer Staples and essential products growth.\nProcter & Gamble Company - Consumer Staples and healthcare.\n\nBy focusing on these companies while diversifying your investments, you aim to achieve a decent return within just one week.\nNot only did this take 3 instances of prompting, but it also just seemed to spew out random stocks. I guess we will see if Deepseek can still pull through in a week."

    "section": "LLAMA Louis",
    "text": "LLAMA Louis\nBelow is the first picture we will be tasking Dalle to recreate. I give it the initial prompt of the following: “Today we are going trying to recreate images of my dog Louis. I want you to pay as much detail to all of the items in the image as well as the orientation of the dog. We will start out with recreating this uploaded image.”\nBelow is the image:\n\nWhen I first put into Chatgpt it recreated it as the following:\n\nNot only did they butcher Louis’s face, but they also made the plushy the wrong type of animal. Because of this, I went to the prompt Chat GPT generated every time it generated an image. It displayed the following: “A detailed recreation of a cozy indoor scene featuring a gray standard poodle lying on a couch. The dog rests its head gently on a brown plush toy with pink feet and a pink face, which has visible wear. The couch is covered with a soft white blanket that has black striped patterns. The dog’s body is stretched out comfortably, with a relaxed and peaceful expression. The lighting is soft and warm, enhancing the calm atmosphere of the scene.”\nFrom the description you can realize that the reason ChatGPT messaged it up is that it simplified the llamma stuffed animal to just a “plush toy.” This can suggest two things a) ChatGPT has a limited amount of stimuli it can describe and recreate, b) Chat GPT doesn’t have the ability to realize what kind of animal the plush toy is, or C) it doesn’t regard it as an important detail.\nTo test these options I told ChatGPT “its a llamma not a dog plush toy” and it generated the following image:\n\nThis image is significantly more accurate than the first generation. Not only did it get the toy correct, it also mimics Louis’s facial expression and the zoom of the picture better. This POTENTAILLY suggests that Chat GPT may have returned to the original reference when creating the llama to then incorporate said llama into the recreation. If that is what Chat GPT then it would help us rule out some of the hypotheses from the last image. It would prove that Chatgpt does have the ability to realize what kind of animal the plush toy is and that it also isn’t limited on the amount of stimulus it can generate. Thus, it would mean that on the original scan of the image - it didn’t regard the type of animal the toy was as an important detail.\nTo figure this out lets run through more scenarios."

    "section": "Blanket Louis",
    "text": "Blanket Louis\nIn this trial, we are going to give Chatgpt a relatively simpler picture of Louis in a blanket. As seen in the picture below, the blanket has a floral pattern. I’m curious to see the extent to which Chatgpt mirrors this pattern. This will help us see if it messed up the Llamma last time because there were too many factors or because it generally doesn’t notice specific details until a second attempt.\nImage I gave Chatgpt:\n\nRecreated Image:\n\nIt generated the following image description: “A detailed recreation of a calm and cozy indoor scene featuring a gray standard poodle lying curled up comfortably on a white bed. The poodle is partially covered with a soft blanket that has a white background and vibrant floral patterns in pink, green, and blue. The dog’s head rests gently on the bed, with its fluffy tail visible and fur neatly groomed. The lighting is natural, soft, and gentle, emphasizing a relaxing atmosphere.”\nWhile this recreation isn’t perfect, it does include the floral pattern displayed on the rug; partially disproving the initial theory that GPT just doesn’t care about specific details of items. Rather it probably only registers specific details about a select number of items - which is why it didn’t note the toy type in the last one. The fact that each description is also the same length, gives credit to this idea of a finite amount of specific details. In every picture it is still interesting to note that while the position has been close, it hasn’t been entirely accurate. Thus, for the final trial I will give it a very simple image."

    "text": "Lounging Louis\nThe final trial is going to be a simple image of Louis in an unconventional position that Chat GPT usually hasn’t been able to match in previous trials. I’ll put the image, recreation, and description below.\nImage I gave Chatgpt:\n\nRecreated Image:\n\nIt generated the following image description: “A cozy indoor scene featuring a gray standard poodle lying on its back with all four paws in the air. The dog rests on a white bed with a quilted texture. The room has soft lighting coming through a window with white blinds, allowing a view of the sky outside. The dog’s body is relaxed and sprawled out comfortably on the bed, with its fluffy fur and groomed poodle style. The calm atmosphere is enhanced by the clean and minimalistic setting.”\nThe theory of the consistent image description length holds true in this trial as well. The description also relatively mirrors the same format in each of the pictures. All 3 start with “indoor scene” and end with a description of the atmosphere and setting. This suggests that there is a finite amount of details per image and they will find or limit details to reach that limit. This is further proven by the fact that it had extra descriptions of Louis’s positioning in this picture.\n\nConclusion\nThis experiment reaffirmed how we learned LLMs process images in class; they scan through the image, noting the key components, and create an image based on that. In this series of trials, Chat GPT was asked to recreate images. Every time it was asked, it would create a description of similar length noting key things in the original image. Oftentimes, it would miss key details in the recreation, but when guided to fix said mistakes - it would do a pretty good job. This shows that while Chat GPT is good at recognizing details in images, but potentially struggles at sorting out which details are key to recreating an image. It also demonstrates that Chat GPT has a limited amount of information it can take in about an image, meaning the more complex an image the less likely it is to recreate it accurately."
